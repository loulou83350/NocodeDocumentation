Every time you hit publish, we build a JavaScript (Vue.js) application. Then, we prerender each page from it that we host on a content delivery network. Search engines can load them fast and read them easily, improving SEO and overall user-experience.",2

Under the hood, these two types of blocks are standard Vue components that have special props so that the WeWeb Editor can communicate with them. We provide a lot of base elements (like editable text or image), but you can also develop your own. They are fully customizable and, when you import them in a WeWeb project, they will be usable by builders inside the WeWeb Editor in the same way as our core components (i.e. you will be able to drag-and-drop them on a page and edit their style with no-code). Each element or section have what we call a content : it's a data object that holds your custom properties. There are two contexts when your element or section can be loaded: inside the editor (Editor mode) or inside the published web-app (Front mode). In Editor mode the content is editable by the user, and saved on our database on each change. In Front mode the content can only change if it is bound to a dynamic value. You can use the configuration file to use our build in logic to edit your section/element content, or handle yourself the edition interface . We have a strip logic available, so even if your element/section has a heavy editing logic, this will have no impact on the published web-app. You can learn more about stripping here Your custom components will inherit the base edition interface , like size, background color or border. Remember that a WeWeb user expects to edit them. You'll want to write your style and javascript with this in mind. If you want to provide values for these WeWeb properties (padding for example), we advise you to drop an instance of your component inside the Editor, change the needed values with the Editor interface, and then save them inside the Design System. The Component source code is responsible for handling content/custom logic, and the Design system is the way to save style/preset of your components.",3

Sections are standalone, and cannot be used inside other components. They offer less edition option, but are easier to design because you have more control on the layout they will appear in (they will be a direct child of your page) An Element is a smaller block. Elements can be used by Sections or other Elements and can be repeated. You can learn how to create a custom component here .",4

Before we show you how to send data from WeWeb to Xano, you therefore need to change the type of the “resume” field in Xano so it’s a “text” type:  Then, to update your Xano database with the user’s job application, follow these steps: Create a workflow on the form container Name: “Submit application”, or anything you find more descriptive Trigger: On Submit, i.e. when the user submits the form Action 1: Upload file Select upload element from this page: select the component variable you setup Test Action 1 before moving on to Action 2 This is very important because you will need the result of Action 1 to set up Action 2, where you will send data to Xano using the POST /application endpoint:  Fields: for each column in the Xano application table, bind the corresponding value in WeWeb. What does this mean? It means that, in Xano, you have 6 columns with data. The keys for these columns are as follows: job_id name resume email phone status In WeWeb, you have a corresponding variable for each key except phone . In the walkthrough below, you can see we: select which fields we want to update in Xano, give Xano the id of the job we are applying to in our Job collection, map the form input variables to the fields in Xano, hard code the fact that every application should have the status ""To be reviewed"" get the link from the file we uploaded in the previous action  Once that’s done, you can test Action 2, refresh the application table in Xano and jump with joy when the test application comes through 😀",22

When building a component, you can trigger events that can then be used outside the component. Let's say, for example, that we have a component called 'Login Form' that is displayed in 2 different parts of our application: on a dedicated login page in a login modal, accessed when the user clicks on a button in the navbar In this example, the 'Login Form' is used to pass the user's input details to our back-end and log the user in. When the user logs in, we will need someway of knowing from which part of the application they have used our 'Login Form' component, as: If they have come from the login page - we need to change the page and direct them to the appropriate screen. If they have come from the login modal - we need to close the modal.

As we introduce more and more functionality in the future, it could become impractial to manage all the branches. We need more flexibility, so using option 2 makes more sense.

We will use this workflow to initialize the camera:  In our component’s workflow, we can add a Custom JavaScript action:  When targeting DOM elements, using document.querySelector() forces a search through the entire document tree. The issue lies with the document object, which represents the whole DOM. This global scope can be inefficient, especially in large or complex web applications.  Binding scripts to the component's scope improves efficiency. Rather than using the global document object, which searches the entire DOM, we use a thisInstance object. This object limits the script's scope to the component's own HTML, ensuring faster and more targeted element selection within the component instance.

They look like this inside the data explorer: Let's deep dive into this: first, you'll find the collection as a whole. It contains your data, and some metadata about the collection (like the number of items, the total number of items, etc.) that WeWeb created. secondly, you'll find the data property. This is the array of data without any metadata . data[index] shows the data for the item at the index index in the collection. It's useful to bind to a specific item in the collection. To change the item, you can use the index dropdown next to the data property. Length is the number of items there are in the collection. isFetching is a boolean that tells you if the collection is currently fetching data. It's useful to display a loading state while the data is being fetched. isFetched is a boolean that tells you if the collection has already been fetched. limit is the max index for the items that are currently displayed in the collection, given any active frontend filter, sort or pagination. total is the total number of items in the collection, given any active frontend filter, sort or pagination. offset is the index of the first item in the collection, given any active frontend filter, sort or pagination.",4

As you can see, you can create groups of filters using condition groups . For each of these groups or conditions, you can set them under certain conditions (using the Apply if... ). For example, when a variable is true or false in your app. You can also use the AND and OR operators to combine filters.

The browser uses this code – i.e. the HTML, CSS, and Javascript information – to render the web page. When the browser finally loads up the page, it displays what you see on the screen. You can see this code in your browser when you open the inspector 🕵️ In fact, you can even change the code on the page. When you change the code, the browser will instantly update what you see on the page. But of course, when you refresh the page, the changes go away because you only made the changes locally in the browser, not in the actual code base hosted on the internet. In the example below, you can see us open the browser’s inspector and update: The HTML text in the button The CSS color and size of the text in the button  HTML is generally used for content. It tells the browser what's on the page. For example, headings, paragraph links, images, etc. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the content. For example, to change the font color or size. In the past, you would have one HTML file where you would write the content and style it. Nowadays, you write and structure the content in an HTML file. Then, you style the content in a CSS file. In the HTML file, you include a link to your CSS file – also called stylesheet – and structure the content with classes and ids that make it easy to style similar elements and components in your CSS file. For example, you might have several HTML files containing the content of several pages on your web app but you would like the buttons to look the same on all the pages. In that case, you could add classes in your HTML files. For example, button-primary and button-secondary could refer to the main CTA button and the secondary CTA button on your pages. Then, in your CSS file, you could style each button class only once. Elements in your HTML file can reference the styles in your CSS file at any time. If you make a change to that style in the CSS file, it affects any element that's using that style in your HTML file.",1

When bound, the data is displayed in the app. It can be displayed as text, as an image, as a link, as a list, etc. Every time the data is updated, the app is updated too. For more details check out the binding data article. Option 1: Binding data This method involves binding the page content directly to a variable. When a user accesses the page, the content is retrieved from this variable. Instead of making an API call to our back end and waiting for its response, we simply update a local variable and display that data on our dynamic page. For example, instead of making an API call to fetch data, you might set a variable with data received from another page. This can be quick and efficient but has limitations. Downside: If a user tries to access that URL directly to the page without going through the initial step that updates the variable, they will land on a page with no information because the variable will be empty. Option 2: Bind to collection data In this approach, the page content is bound to data retrieved from a collection. When a user accesses the page, the data is fetched from the collection, ensuring the content is up-to-date and displayed. This method is more reliable, especially for scenarios where users might access the page directly without going through a specific sequence. Choosing the Right Approach: Dynamic Collection Pages offer flexibility in displaying content based on various criteria. In many use cases, you will want to make an API call to your backend to get the information from the specific item you want to display on the dynamic collection page. What you’ll need 2 Pages A template page to display dynamic data An initial page with items (for this example, we will use a page with a table of data) Plugins Install Rest API (a data source to display data)",2

For this example, we’re starting with the Rick and Morty Database page with all the show's characters. Step 2: Add a Variable Workflow Step 3: Bind the Information on the Dynamic Collection Page Go to the template page and bind the information found in the variable.

When using dynamic collections, you can still use Airtable attachments as image or file URLs in WeWeb because the links are fetched when you fetch a collection (on page load by default or when you trigger the fetch in a Workflow). However, if you are using static or cached collections, you'll need to upload your Airtable attachments to a CDN like Cloudflare or AWS S3, and use the links from the CDN in WeWeb. We realize it's hard tedious work, so we made a small tutorial on how to fix this automatically on Airtable by using Xano to host images, and a small Airtable automation. Step 1: make sure you've got a Xano instance and an endpoint to upload content . Step 2: in Airtable, create a new text column on your table that'll be used to store the images' URLs in the CDN:  Step 3: in Airtable, create an automation that is triggered ""When record updated"" and watch your former image/file column:  Step 4: add an action to run a script and copy/paste this script: Step 5: replace xanoBaseUrl by your own Xano instance and change the column names in the script to match the ones in your table (they are marked with comments in the script). Step 6: activate the automation in Airtable. Now, every time an attachment is added to the column in Airtable, the newly created URL column will display the CDN's URLs, joined by a comma ("",""). To use the images in WeWeb, simply use this newly created column as your images source inside your project (you can get back the URLs by splitting the string on the commas, like so):",14

For example, you might want to fetch a collection when the user opens a modal on a page and not on page load. If you disable the automatic fetch on a collection, you'll need to remember to trigger a workflow that fetches the collection every where you need it in the app. Why disable preserve on navigation? A common use case where you don't want to preserve on navigation: a collection that fetches a single item selected on a previous page (if you preserve on navigation, there might be a blink where the info from the previously selected item appears while the API call takes place to fetch the info of the new selected item) This is especially problematic if the collection data concerns a specific user with potentially private information.

The answer is simple: this ensures your prompts are secure. Indeed, you could make API calls to OpenAI via our REST API plugin but you really shouldn't. Why? Because the calls you make with the REST API plugin are visible in the inspector of the user's browser. This is completely normal by the way. However, when you make an API call that requires a secret API key or includes sensitive data you want to keep private, it's crucial that you make calls through a backend. In the case of OpenAI, there are 2 pieces of information you want to key private: your secret API key, and your prompts.",2

That's why it's important that you protect that intelligence by adding your prompts at plugin level. Let's compare an API call made with the REST API plugin vs an API call made using WeWeb's native integration with OpenAI. First, let's make a request to OpenAI with a standard frontend API call: In the example above, you can see: in the Network tab of the user's browser, you can find the API request, look at the payload of the request, see the prompt we sent to OpenAI, and the private API key linked to our OpenAI account. Now, let's make a request to OpenAI using WeWeb's native integration. First, we'll want to define the prompts we want to keep private at plugin level: Then, we'll make the request using an OpenAI action in a Workflow: In the example above, you can see: in the Network tab of the user's browser, you can find the API request, look at the payload of the request, see the id of the prompt we configured at plugin level, but not its content So if we had put in a lot of work coming up with ""Propose a name for a {fill_in_the_blank}"" to make our product unique, we would be very happy we protected that prompt. Note that you can see the animal variable we included in our prompt and the value of that variable. That's completely fine since the user just filled out that information themselves. It's not confidential or proprietary information. Ok, now that we're clear on why we should keep our prompts secure, let's learn how to use OpenAI actions in Workflows.",3

In the words of OpenAI: ""You input some text as a prompt, and the model will generate a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it."" You can ask a simple question like ""Write a tagline for an ice cream shop"" and it will return something like the answer in highlighted below:  But to leverage the true power of OpenAI, you'll often want to spend some time writing the perfect prompt with detailed instructions on the how you want the answer to look. Let's look at this example:  We go to the Open AI API playground We choose the Complete mode to use text completion We choose the text-davinci-003 model because it's the most recent at the time of writing We set the Temperature to 0 on a scale from 0 to 2 because we want the AI to be mathematical, not creative at all We set the Maximum length of the answer to 2000 characters because we don't want the answer to be restricted to the default 256 We write a prompt that asks OpenAI to return a regular expression patterns for emails in a certain format that we can easily reuse in our app to validate user inputs in an email field, i.e. the regular expression itself and an explanation of how it works We click on Submit Open AI returns an answer As you can see, a lot of thought went into the prompt: we said we wanted users to input email addresses we asked OpenAI to return the regular expression pattern in a specific format we asked OpenAI to include a text to explain how the regex was built So how would it work in WeWeb? Well, you would take the prompt you engineered in the OpenAI playground and copy it in the plugin:  To add a prompt, you'll need to click on Add item . For each prompt, you can add as many variables as you want. When you click on Add variable , a new variable will be added to your prompt content with the default {{var1}} value:  You'll want to give it a more descriptive name so that, when you build your API request to OpenAI, you remember what value is expected. In our Return Regex prompt above, we had a variable named {{need}} . When we configure the API call to OpenAI in a Workflow, it's easy for us to replicated what we had in the OpenAI API playground:  In the example above, you can see: we're making a request to OpenAI's Complete API based on the text-davinci-003 model using the Return Regex prompt we configured in the plugin binding the {{need}} variable we set in the plugin to a variable on our page with a maximum token of 2000 to ensure we get a reply, and a temperature of 0 to ensure that the reply is not creative To learn more about how to work with these settings, please refer to the OpenAI API documentation .",4

In WeWeb, we'll create a workflow that does the following when a user asks a question: we update our list of messages with the user's question we send that list of messages to OpenAI when OpenAI answers, we update our list of messages with the AI's answer Three things to keep in mind: if we don't send the expected format (i.e. an array of objects), the API will return an error message, so we need to make sure we include the role and content of each message if we don't send the entire message sequence, the AI will not have the entire context of the conversation if we send the entire message sequence but don't follow the sequential order of the conversation, the AI will not have the right context Let's take a look at a simple example to make things clearer.",7

Historically, static website builders like Webflow and builders with server-side rendering (SSR) like WordPress had an SEO advantage over tools like WeWeb, Bubble, and others that generate dynamic content in JavaScript. This happens because when search engine bots first visit a JavaScript application, they initially see only the base HTML file before any JavaScript runs. In dynamic applications like WeWeb, this base file is nearly empty since all content is added later by JavaScript running in the browser. By contrast, static/SSR sites deliver complete HTML with all content already included. However, in recent years, search engines have significantly evolved to better handle JavaScript content, as more websites are built with modern JS frameworks like React or Vue. While the initial indexing might take a few extra days compared to static sites, search engine bots now effectively crawl and index JavaScript-based content during subsequent visits. Here are Google’s thoughts on the topic :",33

The general idea is the following: A realtime channel allows a client (the user's browser) and server (Supabase) to send and receive realtime events. Those events can be ephemereal (Broadcast) or permanent (Database changes). If users want to receive or send events in a channel, they first need to subscribe to that channel (via a WeWeb workflow action). Once they've subscribed to a channel, users can broadcast messages to that channel (via a WeWeb workflow action). They can also listen to events sent by other users in that channel (via a WeWeb workflow triggered on page or app load).",4

You would also have an app workflow that: listens for messages from other users in the chat channel. updates a variable with those messages.
