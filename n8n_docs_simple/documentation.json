    "content": "Hosting n8n on Azure# This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Azure. It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy. Prerequisites# You need The Azure command line tool Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including: Setting up and configuring servers and containers Managing application resources and scaling Securing servers and applications Configuring n8n n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud. Latest and Next versions n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum. Current latest: 1.86.1 Current next: 1.88.0 Hosting options# Azure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes). This guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes. The steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks. Open the Azure Kubernetes Service# From the Azure portal select Kubernetes services. Create a cluster# From the Kubernetes services page, select Create > Create a Kubernetes cluster. You can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select Create when done. Set Kubectl context# The remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the Connect button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster. Clone configuration repository# Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from this repository. The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change. Clone the repository with the following command: 1 git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b azure And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned: 1 cd azure Configure Postgres# For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite. Configure volume for persistent storage# To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest. Specialized storage classes If you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes, read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation. Postgres environment variables# Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers. The example postgres-secret.yaml file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database.. The postgres-deployment.yaml manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods. Configure n8n# Create a volume for file storage# While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for: Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node. If you want to persist manual n8n encryption keys between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup. The n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the volumes section of the n8n-deployment.yaml manifest. 1 2 3 4 5 6 … volumes: - name: n8n-claim0 persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: n8n-claim0 … Pod resources# Kubernetes lets you optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the resources section of the n8n-deployment.yaml file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 … resources: requests: memory: \"250Mi\" limits: memory: \"500Mi\" … This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings: Start: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable Pro (10k executions): 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable Pro (50k executions): 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable Optional: Environment variables# You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables. Create an n8n-secret.yaml file. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details. Deployments# The two deployment manifests (n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes. The manifests define the following: Send the environment variables defined to each application pod Define the container image to use Set resource consumption limits with the resources object The volumes defined earlier and volumeMounts to define the path in the container to mount volumes. Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs. Services# The two service manifests (postgres-service.yaml and n8n-service.yaml) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively. Send to Kubernetes cluster# Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command: 1 kubectl apply -f . Namespace error You may see an error message about not finding an \"n8n\" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command: 1 kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml Set up DNS# n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the Services & ingresses menu item of the cluster you want to use under the External IP column. You need to add the n8n port, \"5678\" to the URL. Static IP addresses with AKS Read this tutorial for more details on how to use a static IP address with AKS. Delete resources# Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command: 1 kubectl delete -f . Next steps# Learn more about configuring and scaling n8n.

Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. How the MCP Server Trigger node works# The MCP Server Trigger node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. Unlike conventional trigger nodes, which respond to events and pass their output to the next connected node, the MCP Server Trigger node only connects to and executes tool nodes. Clients can list the available tools and call individual tools to perform work. You can expose n8n workflows to clients by attaching them with the Custom n8n Workflow Tool node. Server-Sent Events (SSE) support The MCP Server Trigger node supports Server-Sent Events (SSE), a long-lived transport built on top of HTTP, for connections between clients and the server. It currently doesn't support standard input/output (stdio) transport. Node parameters# Use these parameters to configure your node. MCP URL# The MCP Server Trigger node has two MCP URLs: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select Test URL or Production URL to toggle which URL n8n displays. Test: n8n registers a test MCP URL when you select Listen for Test Event or Test workflow, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the MCP URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow. Production: n8n registers a production MCP URL when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the Executions tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view. Authentication# You can require authentication for clients connecting to your MCP URL. Choose from these authentication methods: Bearer auth Header auth Refer to the HTTP request credentials for more information on setting up each credential type. Path# By default, this field contains a randomly generated MCP URL path, to avoid conflicts with other MCP Server Trigger nodes. You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs. The Path field can take the following formats: /:variable /path/:variable /:variable/path /:variable1/path/:variable2 /:variable1/:variable2 Templates and examples# 💥🛠️Build a Web Search Chatbot with GPT-4o and MCP Brave Search by Joseph LePage View template details AI-Powered Research Assistant for Platform Questions with GPT-4o and MCP by Onur View template details Automate Blog Content Creation with Notion MCP, DeepSeek AI, and WordPress by Dr. Firas View template details Browse MCP Server Trigger integration templates, or search all templates Integrating with Claude Desktop# You can connect to the MCP Server Trigger node from Claude Desktop by running a gateway to proxy SSE messages to stdio-based servers.

Enable filesystem mode# When handling binary data, n8n keeps the data in memory by default. This can cause crashes when working with large files. To avoid this, change the N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE environment variable to filesystem. This causes n8n to save data to disk, instead of using memory. If you're using queue mode, keep this to default. n8n doesn't support filesystem mode with queue mode. Binary data pruning# n8n executes binary data pruning as part of execution data pruning. Refer to Execution data | Enable data pruning for details. If you configure multiple binary data modes, binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. Refer to External storage for details."

Theme colors# To customize theme colors open packages/design-system and start with: packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss At the top of _tokens.scss you will find --color-primary variables as HSL colors: 1 2 3 4 @mixin theme { --color-primary-h: 6.9; --color-primary-s: 100%; --color-primary-l: 67.6%; In the following example the primary color changes to #0099ff. To convert to HSL you can use a color converter tool. 1 2 3 4 @mixin theme { --color-primary-h: 204; --color-primary-s: 100%; --color-primary-l: 50%; Theme logos# To change the editor’s logo assets look into packages/editor-ui/public and replace: favicon-16x16.png favicon-32x32.png favicon.ico n8n-logo.svg n8n-logo-collapsed.svg n8n-logo-expanded.svg Replace these logo assets. n8n uses them in Vue.js components, including: MainSidebar.vue: top/left logo in the main sidebar. Logo.vue: reused in other components. In the following example replace n8n-logo-collapsed.svg and n8n-logo-expanded.svg to update the main sidebar's logo assets. If your logo assets require different sizing or placement you can customize SCSS styles at the bottom of MainSidebar.vue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 .logoItem { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; height: $header-height; line-height: $header-height; margin: 0 !important; border-radius: 0 !important; border-bottom: var(--border-width-base) var(--border-style-base) var(--color-background-xlight); cursor: default; &:hover, &:global(.is-active):hover { background-color: initial !important; } * { vertical-align: middle; } .icon { height: 18px; position: relative; left: 6px; } } Text localization# To change all text occurrences like n8n or n8n.io to your brand identity you can customize n8n's English internationalization file: packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json. n8n uses the Vue I18n internationalization plugin for Vue.js to translate the majority of UI texts. To search and replace text occurrences inside en.json you can use Linked locale messages. In the following example add the _brand.name translation key to white label n8n's AboutModal.vue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 { \"_brand.name\": \"My Brand\", //replace n8n with link to _brand.name \"about.aboutN8n\": \"About @:_brand.name\", \"about.n8nVersion\": \"@:_brand.name Version\", } Window title# To change n8n's window title to your brand name, edit the following: packages/editor-ui/index.html packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts The following example replaces all occurrences of n8n and n8n.io with My Brand in index.html and titleChange.ts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <!-- Replace html title attribute --> <title>My Brand - Workflow Automation</title> </head> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 $titleSet(workflow: string, status: WorkflowTitleStatus) { // replace n8n prefix window.document.title = `My Brand - ${icon} ${workflow}`; }, $titleReset() { // replace n8n prefix document.title = `My Brand - Workflow Automation`; },"

If you don't set EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE, 336 hours (14 days) is the default. You can choose to prune finished executions data before the time set in EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE, using EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT. This sets a maximum number of executions to store in the database. Once you reach the limit, n8n starts to delete the oldest execution records.

Want to dive deeper into n8n after taking the Level 1 course. What will I learn in this course?# The focus in this course is on working with data. You will learn how to: Use the data structure of n8n correctly. Process different data types (for example, XML, HTML, date, time, and binary data). Merge data from different sources (for example, a database, spreadsheet, or CRM). Use functions and JavaScript code in the Code node. Deal with error workflows and workflow errors. You will learn all this by completing short practical exercises after the theoretical explanations and building a business workflow following instructions. What do I need to get started?# To follow along this course (at a comfortable pace) you will need the following: n8n set up: You can use the self-hosted version or n8n Cloud. A user ID: Sign up here to get your unique ID and other credentials you will need in the course. Basic n8n skills: We strongly recommend taking the Level 1 course before this one. Basic JavaScript understanding How long does the course take?# Completing the course should take around two hours. You don't have to complete it in one go; feel free to take breaks and resume whenever you are ready. How do I complete the course?# There are two milestones in this course that test your knowledge of what you have learned in the lessons: Building the main workflow Passing the quiz at the end of the course You can always check your progress throughout the course by entering your unique ID here. If you successfully complete the milestones above, you will get a badge and an avatar in your forum profile.

Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name.

Mode# You can either use Manual Mapping to edit fields using the GUI or JSON Output to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data. Fields to Set# If you select Mode > Manual Mapping, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from INPUT. The default behavior when you drag a value is: n8n sets the value's name as the field name. The field value contains an expression which accesses the value. If you don't want to use expressions: Hover over a field. n8n displays the Fixed | Expressions toggle. Select Fixed. You can do this for both the name and value of the field. Keep Only Set Fields# Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in Fields to Set. Include in Output# Choose which input data to include in the node's output data. Node options# Use these options to customize the behavior of the node. Include Binary Data# If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data. Ignore Type Conversion Errors# Manual Mapping only. Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields. Support Dot Notation# By default, n8n supports dot notation. For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the Name field. That means if you set the name in the Name field as number.one and the value in the Value field as 20, the resulting JSON is: 1 { \"number\": { \"one\": 20} } You can prevent this behavior by selecting Add Option > Support Dot Notation, and setting the Dot Notion field to off.

For example, you can store values in GitHub secrets, then populate the variables in n8n using an API call from a GitHub Action. To manage variables using an API call, make a POST request to /source-control/pull: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 curl --location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \\ --data '{ \"force\": true, \"variables\": { \"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\" } } ' If the key already exists in n8n, the API call updates the value.

There's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries.

This document provides guidance on good code practices for node building. It focuses on code details. For UI standards and UX guidance, refer to Node UI design. Use the linter# The n8n node linter provides automatic checking for many of the node-building standards. You should ensure your node passes the linter's checks before publishing it. Refer to the n8n node linter documentation for more information. Use the starter# The n8n node starter project includes a recommended setup, dependencies (including the linter), and examples to help you get started. Begin new projects with the starter. Write in TypeScript# All n8n code is TypeScript. Writing your nodes in TypeScript can speed up development and reduce bugs. Detailed guidelines for writing a node# These guidelines apply to any node you build. Resources and operations# If your node can perform several operations, call the parameter that sets the operation Operation. If your node can do these operations on more than one resource, create a Resource parameter. The following code sample shows a basic resource and operations setup: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 export const ExampleNode implements INodeType { description: { displayName: 'Example Node', ... properties: [ { displayName: 'Resource', name: 'resource', type: 'options', options: [ { name: 'Resource One', value: 'resourceOne' }, { name: 'Resource Two', value: 'resourceTwo' } ], default: 'resourceOne' }, { displayName: 'Operation', name: 'operation', type: 'options', // Only show these operations for Resource One displayOptions: { show: { resource: [ 'resourceOne' ] } }, options: [ { name: 'Create', value: 'create', description: 'Create an instance of Resource One' } ] } ] } } Reuse internal parameter names# All resource and operation fields in an n8n node have two settings: a display name, set using the name parameter, and an internal name, set using the value parameter. Reusing the internal name for fields allows n8n to preserve user-entered data if a user switches operations. For example: you're building a node with a resource named 'Order'. This resource has several operations, including Get, Edit, and Delete. Each of these operations uses an order ID to perform the operation on the specified order. You need to display an ID field for the user. This field has a display label, and an internal name. By using the same internal name (set in value) for the operation ID field on each resource, a user can enter the ID with the Get operation selected, and not lose it if they switch to Edit. When reusing the internal name, you must ensure that only one field is visible to the user at a time. You can control this using displayOptions. Detailed guidelines for writing a programmatic-style node# These guidelines apply when building nodes using the programmatic node-building style. They aren't relevant when using the declarative style. For more information on different node-building styles, refer to Choose your node building approach. Don't change incoming data# Never change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with this.getInputData()) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data. It's not necessary to always clone all the data. For example, if a node changes the binary data but not the JSON data, you can create a new item that reuses the reference to the JSON item. Use the built in request library# Some third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // If no auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options); // If auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call( this, 'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi options, ); This uses the npm package Axios.

    "content": "Cloud data management# There are two concerns when managing data on Cloud: Memory usage: complex workflows processing large amounts of data can exceed n8n's memory limits. If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible. Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage. To avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data Memory limits on each Cloud plan# Current plans: Trial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable Starter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable Pro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable Pro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable Enterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable Legacy plans: Start: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable Power: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable n8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage. How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow# The way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory. Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution. Avoid using the Code node where possible. Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data. Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow. Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the Loop Over Items node to split up the items into smaller batches and the Execute Workflow node to start the sub-workflow. However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again. Note that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM. Interactions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit. How to manage execution data on Cloud# Execution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based. Binary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data. If a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions. There are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database: In the admin dashboard: From your workspace or editor, navigate to Admin Panel. Select Manage. In Executions to Save deselect the executions you don't want to log. In your workflow settings: Select the Options menu. Select Settings. n8n opens the Workflow settings modal. Change Save successful production executions to Do not save. Cloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention# Automatic data pruning# n8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan: Start and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention; Pro and Power plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention; Enterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time. Manual data pruning# Heavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability. An alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity. n8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data. Due to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up."

The file and directory structure of your node depends on: Your node's complexity. Whether you use node versioning. How many nodes you include in the npm package. Required files and directories# Your node must include: A package.json file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module. A nodes directory, containing the code for your node: This directory must contain the base file, in the format <node-name>.node.ts. For example, MyNode.node.ts. n8n recommends including a codex file, containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named MyNode.node.ts, the codex name is MyNode.node.json. The nodes directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure. A credentials directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single credentials file. The filename format is <node-name>.credentials.ts. For example, MyNode.credentials.ts. Modular structure# You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out. A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the HttpBin starter node for an example of this. For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the Airtable node or Microsoft Outlook node as examples. actions: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources. Each sub-directory should contain two types of files: An index file with resource description (named either <resourceName>.resource.ts or index.ts) Files for operations <operationName>.operation.ts. These files should have two exports: description of the operation and an execute function. methods: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions. transport: a directory containing the communication implementation. Versioning# If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to Node versioning for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning. Decide how many nodes to include in a package# There are two possible setups when building a node: One node in one npm package. More than one node in a single npm package. n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the nodes directory.

The process consists of five steps: Add a Manual Trigger node Add the Hacker News node Configure the Hacker News node Execute the node Save the workflow The finished workflow will look like this: View workflow file 1. Add a Manual Trigger node# Open the nodes panel (reminder: you can open this by selecting the + icon in the top right corner of the canvas or selecting Tab on your keyboard). Then: Search for the Manual Trigger node. Select it when it appears in the search. This will add the Manual Trigger node to your canvas, which allows you to run the workflow at any time by selecting the Test workflow button. Manual triggers For faster workflow creation, you can skip this step in the future. Adding any other node without a trigger will add the Manual Trigger node to the workflow. In a real-world scenario, you would probably want to set up a schedule or some other trigger to run the workflow. 2. Add the Hacker News node# Select the + icon to the right of the Manual Trigger node to open the nodes panel. Then: Search for the Hacker News node. Select it when it appears in the search. In the Actions section, select Get many items. n8n adds the node to your canvas and the node window opens to display its configuration details. 3. Configure the Hacker News node# When you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated. The node details will open in a window with several options: Parameters: Adjust parameters to refine and control the node's functionality. Settings: Adjust settings to control the node's design and executions. Docs: Open the n8n documentation for this node in a new window. Parameters vs. Settings Parameters are different for each node, depending on its functionality. Settings are the same for all nodes. Parameters# We need to configure several parameters for the Hacker News node to make it work: Resource: All This resource selects all data records (articles). Operation: Get Many This operation fetches all the selected articles. Limit: 10 This parameter sets a limit to the number of results the Get Many operation returns. Additional Fields > Add Field > Keyword: automation Additional fields are options that you can add to certain nodes to make your request more specific or filter the results. For this example, we want to get only articles that include the keyword \"automation.\" The configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this: Hacker News node parameters Settings# The Settings section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we'll configure only the final two settings, which set the node's appearance in the Editor UI canvas. In the Hacker News node Settings, edit: Notes: Get the 10 latest articles. Node notes It's often helpful to add a short description in the node about what it does. This is helpful for complex or shared workflows in particular! Display note in flow?: toggle to true This option will display the Note under the node in the canvas. The configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node should now look like this: Hacker News node settings Renaming a node You can rename the node with a name that's more descriptive for your use case. There are three ways to do this: Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard. Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click Rename to save the node under the new name. Right-click on the node and select the Rename option, or select the node and press F2 on your keyboard. Renaming a node from the keyboard To find the original node name (the type of node), open the node window and select Settings. The bottom of the page contains the node type and version. 4. Execute the node# Select the Test step button in the node details window. You should see 10 results in the Output Table view. Results in Table view for the Hacker News node Node executions# Node execution A node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve or process the specified data. If a node executes successfully, a small green checkmark appears on top of the node in the canvas Successfully executed workflow If there are no problems with the parameters and everything works fine, the requested data displays in the node window in Table, JSON, and Schema format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the Table | JSON | Schema button at the top of the node window. Table vs JSON views The Table view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records. Here's our Hacker News output in JSON view: Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node The node window displays more information about the node execution: Next to the Output title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node execution succeeded). Beside it, there is an info icon. If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow: Start Time: When the node execution started. Execution Time: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing. Just below the Output title, you'll notice another piece of information: 10 items. This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned. Error in nodes A red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly. Error in nodes 5. Save the workflow# Once you're finished editing the node, select Back to canvas to return to the main canvas. By default, your workflow is automatically saved as \"My workflow.\" For this lesson, rename the workflow to be \"Hacker News workflow.\" Reminder You can rename a workflow by clicking on the workflow's name at the top of the Editor UI. Once you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it. There are two ways in which you can save a workflow: From the Canvas in Editor UI, click Ctrl + S or Cmd + S on your keyboard. Select the Save button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog. If you see a grey Saved text instead of the Save button, your workflow was automatically saved. Summary# Congratulations, you just built your first workflow! In this lesson, you learned how to use actions in app nodes, configure their parameters and settings, and save and execute your workflow. In the next lesson, you'll meet your new client, Nathan, who needs to automate his sales reporting work. You will build a more complex workflow for his use case, helping him become more productive at work."

    "content": "Build a programmatic-style node# This tutorial walks through building a programmatic-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to Choose your node building approach for more information. Prerequisites# You need the following installed on your development machine: git Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL here. For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to Install NodeJS on Windows. You need some understanding of: JavaScript/TypeScript REST APIs git Expressions in n8n Build your node# In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the SendGrid. You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact. Existing node n8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name. Step 1: Set up the project# n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter. Clone the repository and navigate into the directory: Generate a new repository from the template repository. Clone your new repository: 1 2 git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid cd n8n-nodes-friendgrid The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files: nodes/ExampleNode nodes/HTTPBin credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts Now create the following directories and files: nodes/FriendGrid nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts These are the key files required for any node. Refer to Node file structure for more information on required files and recommended organization. Now install the project dependencies: 1 npm i Step 2: Add an icon# Save the SendGrid SVG logo from here as friendGrid.svg in nodes/FriendGrid/. n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio. Don't reference Font Awesome If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image. Step 3: Define the node in the base file# Every node must have a base file. Refer to Node base file for detailed information about base file parameters. In this example, the file is FriendGrid.node.ts. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to Node file structure for more information. Step 3.1: Imports# Start by adding the import statements: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 import { IExecuteFunctions, } from 'n8n-core'; import { IDataObject, INodeExecutionData, INodeType, INodeTypeDescription, } from 'n8n-workflow'; import { OptionsWithUri, } from 'request'; Step 3.2: Create the main class# The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a description interface, which in turn contains the properties array. Class names and file names Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class FriendGrid, the filename must be FriendGrid.node.ts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 export class FriendGrid implements INodeType { description: INodeTypeDescription = { // Basic node details will go here properties: [ // Resources and operations will go here ], }; // The execute method will go here async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> { } } Step 3.3: Add node details# All programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the description: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 displayName: 'FriendGrid', name: 'friendGrid', icon: 'file:friendGrid.svg', group: ['transform'], version: 1, description: 'Consume SendGrid API', defaults: { name: 'FriendGrid', }, inputs: ['main'], outputs: ['main'], credentials: [ { name: 'friendGridApi', required: true, }, ], n8n uses some of the properties set in description to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are displayName, icon, and description. Step 3.4: Add the resource# The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: /v3/marketing/contacts. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the properties array with the resource object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 { displayName: 'Resource', name: 'resource', type: 'options', options: [ { name: 'Contact', value: 'contact', }, ], default: 'contact', noDataExpression: true, required: true, description: 'Create a new contact', }, type controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. options results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to Node UI elements for more information. Step 3.5: Add operations# The operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates. Add the following to the properties array, after the resource object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 { displayName: 'Operation', name: 'operation', type: 'options', displayOptions: { show: { resource: [ 'contact', ], }, }, options: [ { name: 'Create', value: 'create', description: 'Create a contact', action: 'Create a contact', }, ], default: 'create', noDataExpression: true, }, { displayName: 'Email', name: 'email', type: 'string', required: true, displayOptions: { show: { operation: [ 'create', ], resource: [ 'contact', ], }, }, default:'', placeholder: 'name@email.com', description:'Primary email for the contact', }, Step 3.6: Add optional fields# Most APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query. To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under Additional Fields in the UI. For this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 { displayName: 'Additional Fields', name: 'additionalFields', type: 'collection', placeholder: 'Add Field', default: {}, displayOptions: { show: { resource: [ 'contact', ], operation: [ 'create', ], }, }, options: [ { displayName: 'First Name', name: 'firstName', type: 'string', default: '', }, { displayName: 'Last Name', name: 'lastName', type: 'string', default: '', }, ], }, Step 4: Add the execute method# You've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something. The execute method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials. Add the following the execute method in the FriendGrid.node.ts: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 // Handle data coming from previous nodes const items = this.getInputData(); let responseData; const returnData = []; const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string; const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string; // For each item, make an API call to create a contact for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { if (resource === 'contact') { if (operation === 'create') { // Get email input const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string; // Get additional fields input const additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', i) as IDataObject; const data: IDataObject = { email, }; Object.assign(data, additionalFields); // Make HTTP request according to https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/ const options: OptionsWithUri = { headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json', }, method: 'PUT', body: { contacts: [ data, ], }, uri: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`, json: true, }; responseData = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(this, 'friendGridApi', options); returnData.push(responseData); } } } // Map data to n8n data structure return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)]; Note the following lines of this code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 const items = this.getInputData(); ... for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { ... const email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string; ... } Users can provide data in two ways: Entered directly in the node fields By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow getInputData(), and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts. Step 5: Set up authentication# The SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key. Add the following to FriendGridApi.credentials.ts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 import { IAuthenticateGeneric, ICredentialTestRequest, ICredentialType, INodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow'; export class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType { name = 'friendGridApi'; displayName = 'FriendGrid API'; properties: INodeProperties[] = [ { displayName: 'API Key', name: 'apiKey', type: 'string', default: '', }, ]; authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { type: 'generic', properties: { headers: { Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.apiKey}}', }, }, }; test: ICredentialTestRequest = { request: { baseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3', url: '/marketing/contacts', }, }; } For more information about credentials files and options, refer to Credentials file. Step 6: Add node metadata# Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is FriendGrid.node.json. Add the following code to the JSON file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 { \"node\": \"n8n-nodes-base.FriendGrid\", \"nodeVersion\": \"1.0\", \"codexVersion\": \"1.0\", \"categories\": [ \"Miscellaneous\" ], \"resources\": { \"credentialDocumentation\": [ { \"url\": \"\" } ], \"primaryDocumentation\": [ { \"url\": \"\" } ] } } For more information on these parameters, refer to Node codex files. Step 7: Update the npm package details# Your npm package details are in the package.json at the root of the project. It's essential to include the n8n object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 { // All node names must start with \"n8n-nodes-\" \"name\": \"n8n-nodes-friendgrid\", \"version\": \"0.1.0\", \"description\": \"n8n node to create contacts in SendGrid\", \"keywords\": [ // This keyword is required for community nodes \"n8n-community-node-package\" ], \"license\": \"MIT\", \"homepage\": \"https://n8n.io\", \"author\": { \"name\": \"Test\", \"email\": \"test@example.com\" }, \"repository\": { \"type\": \"git\", // Change the git remote to your own repository // Add the new URL here \"url\": \"git+<your-repo-url>\" }, \"main\": \"index.js\", \"scripts\": { // don't change }, \"files\": [ \"dist\" ], // Link the credentials and node \"n8n\": { \"n8nNodesApiVersion\": 1, \"credentials\": [ \"dist/credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.js\" ], \"nodes\": [ \"dist/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.js\" ] }, \"devDependencies\": { // don't change }, \"peerDependencies\": { // don't change } } You need to update the package.json to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm package.json files, refer to npm's package.json documentation. Test your node# You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance. Install n8n using npm: 1 npm install n8n -g When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally: 1 2 3 # In your node directory npm run build npm link Install the node into your local n8n instance: 1 2 3 # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation # node-package-name is the name from the package.json npm link <node-package-name> Check your directory Make sure you run npm link <node-name> in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be: ~/.n8n/custom/ ~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>: if your n8n installation set a different name using N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS. Start n8n: 1 n8n start Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel. Node names Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is n8n-nodes-weather-nodes, and the package contains nodes named rain, sun, snow, you should search for rain, not weather-nodes. Troubleshooting# There's no custom directory in ~/.n8n local installation. You have to create custom directory manually and run npm init 1 2 3 4 # In ~/.n8n directory run mkdir custom cd custom npm init Next steps# Deploy your node. View an example of a programmatic node: n8n's Mattermost node. This is an example of a more complex programmatic node structure. Learn about node versioning. Make sure you understand key concepts: item linking and data structures."

    "content": "Workflow 2: Generating reports# In this workflow, you will merge data from different sources, transform binary data, generate files, and send notifications about them. The final workflow should look like this: Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files To make things easier, let's split the workflow into three parts. Part 1: Getting data from different sources# The first part of the workflow consists of five nodes: Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources Use the HTTP Request node to get data from the API endpoint that stores company data. Configure the following node parameters: Method: Get URL: The Dataset URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course. Authentication: Generic Credential Type Generic Auth Type: Header Auth Credentials for Header Auth: The Header Auth name and Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course. Send Headers: Toggle to true Specify Headers: Select Using Fields Below Name: unique_id Value: The unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course. Use the Airtable node to list data from the customers table (where you updated the fields region and subregion). Use the Merge node to merge data from the Airtable and HTTP Request node, based on matching the input fields for customerID. Use the Sort node to sort data by orderPrice in descending order. Quiz questions What's the name of the employee assigned to customer 1? What's the order status of customer 2? What's the highest order price? Part 2: Generating file for regional sales# The second part of the workflow consists of four nodes: Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales Use the If node to filter to only display orders from the region Americas. Use the Convert to File to transform the incoming data from JSON to binary format. Convert each item to a separate file. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to name each report based on the orderID!) Use the Gmail node (or another email node) to send the files using email to an address you have access to. Note that you need to add an attachment with the data property. Use the Discord node to send a message in the n8n Discord channel #course-level-two. In the node, configure the following parameters: Webhook URL: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course. Text: \"I sent the file using email with the label ID {label ID}. My ID: \" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course. Note that you need to replace the text in curly braces {} with expressions that reference the data from the nodes. Quiz questions How many orders are assigned to the Americas region? What's the total price of the orders in the Americas region? How many items does the Write Binary File node return? Part 3: Generating files for total sales# The third part of the workflow consists of five nodes: Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales Use the Loop Over Items node to split data from the Item Lists node into batches of 5. Use the Set node to set four values, referenced with expressions from the previous node: customerEmail, customerRegion, customerSince, and orderPrice. Use the Date & Time node to change the date format of the field customerSince to the format MM/DD/YYYY. Set the Include Input Fields option to keep all the data together. Use the Convert to File node to create a CSV spreadsheet with the file name set as the expression: {{$runIndex > 0 ? 'file_low_orders':'file_high_orders'}}. Use the Discord node to send a message in the n8n Discord channel #course-level-two. In the node, configure the following parameters: Webhook URL: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course. Text: \"I created the spreadsheet {file name}. My ID:\" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course. Note that you need to replace {file name} with an expression that references data from the previous Convert to File node. Quiz questions What's the lowest order price in the first batch of items?

    "content": "Hosting n8n on Google Cloud# This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Google Cloud (GCP). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy. Prerequisites# The gcloud command line tool The gke-gcloud-auth-plugin (install the gcloud CLI first) Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including: Setting up and configuring servers and containers Managing application resources and scaling Securing servers and applications Configuring n8n n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud. Latest and Next versions n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum. Current latest: 1.86.1 Current next: 1.88.0 Hosting options# Google Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes). This guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes. Most of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the gcloud command line tool instead to undertake all the steps. Create project# GCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the NEW PROJECT button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected. Enable the Kubernetes Engine API# GKE isn't enabled by default. Search for \"Kubernetes\" in the top search bar and select \"Kubernetes Engine\" from the results. Select ENABLE to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project. Create a cluster# From the GKE service page, select Clusters > CREATE. Make sure you select the \"Standard\" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an \"Autopilot\" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location. Set Kubectl context# The rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting CONNECT. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster. Clone configuration repository# Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from this repository locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information. Clone the repository with the following command: 1 git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b gcp And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned: 1 cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting Configure Postgres# For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite. Create a volume for persistent storage# To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read this guide for specifics, but the storage.yaml manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the allowedTopologies > matchedLabelExpressions > values key. By default, they're set to us-central. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 … allowedTopologies: - matchLabelExpressions: - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone values: - us-central1-b - us-central1-c Postgres environment variables# Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers. The example postgres-secret.yaml file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database.. The postgres-deployment.yaml manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods. Configure n8n# Create a volume for file storage# While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for: Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node. If you want to persist manual n8n encryption keys between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup. The n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the volumes section of the n8n-deployment.yaml manifest. 1 2 3 4 5 6 … volumes: - name: n8n-claim0 persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: n8n-claim0 … Pod resources# Kubernetes lets you optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the resources section of the n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml files: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 … resources: requests: memory: \"250Mi\" limits: memory: \"500Mi\" … This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings: Start: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable Pro (10k executions): 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable Pro (50k executions): 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable Optional: Environment variables# You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables. Create an n8n-secret.yaml file. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details. Deployments# The two deployment manifests (n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes. The manifests define the following: Send the environment variables defined to each application pod Define the container image to use Set resource consumption limits with the resources object The volumes defined earlier and volumeMounts to define the path in the container to mount volumes. Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs. Services# The two service manifests (postgres-service.yaml and n8n-service.yaml) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively. Send to Kubernetes cluster# Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command: 1 kubectl apply -f . Namespace error You may see an error message about not finding an \"n8n\" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command: 1 kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml Set up DNS# n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the Services & Ingress menu item of the cluster you want to use under the Endpoints column. GKE and IP addresses Read this GKE tutorial for more details on how reserved IP addresses work with GKE and Kubernetes resources.

When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues. Operations# The Wait node can Resume on the following conditions: After Time Interval: The node waits for a certain amount of time. At Specified Time: The node waits until a specific time. On Webhook Call: The node waits until it receives an HTTP call. On Form Submitted: The node waits until it receives a form submission. Refer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions. After Time Interval# Wait for a certain amount of time. This parameter includes two more fields: Wait Amount: Enter the amount of time to wait. Wait Unit: Select the unit of measure for the Wait Amount. Choose from: Seconds Minutes Hours Days Refer to Time-based operations for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used. At Specified Time# Wait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the Date and Time. Refer to Time-based operations for more detail on the timezone used. On Webhook Call# This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call. The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the $execution.resumeUrl variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email. When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the $execution.resumeUrl. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially. For this Resume style, set more parameters listed below. Authentication# Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to $execution.resumeUrl should be authenticated. Options include: Basic Auth: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new Credential for Basic Auth to use. Header Auth: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new Credential for Header Auth to use. JWT Auth: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new Credential for JWT Auth to use. None: Don't use authentication. Auth reference Refer to the Webhook node | Authentication documentation for more information on each auth type. HTTP Method# Select the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation for more information. Response Code# Enter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code. Respond# Set when and how to respond to the webhook from these options: Immediately: Respond as soon as the node executes. When Last Node Finishes: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set: Response Data: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include: All Entries: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array. First Entry JSON: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object. First Entry Binary: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file. No Response Body: Return with no body. Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node: Respond as defined in the Respond to Webhook node. Limit Wait Time# Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set: Limit Type: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options: After Time Interval: Wait for a certain amount of time. Enter the limit's Amount of time. Select the limit's Unit of time. At Specified Time: Wait until a specific date and time to resume. Max Date and Time: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume. On Webhook Call options# Binary Property: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received. Ignore Bots: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off). IP(s) Whitelist: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL. No Response Body: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on). Raw Body: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off). Response Data: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response. Response Headers: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to MDN Web Docs | Response header to learn more about response headers. Webhook Suffix: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated $resumeWebhookUrl won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it. On Webhook Call limitations# There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call: Partial executions of your workflow changes the $resumeWebhookUrl, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node. On Form Submitted# Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters: Form Title# Enter the title to display at the top of the form. Form Description# Enter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.

On Form Response options# Form Response: Choose how and what you want the form to Respond With from these options: Form Submitted Text: The form displays whatever text is entered in Text to Show after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message. Redirect URL: The form will redirect the user to the URL to Redirect to after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL. Webhook Suffix: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated $resumeWebhookUrl won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Pinecone node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here.

Node usage patterns# You can use the Pinecone Vector Store node in the following patterns. Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents# You can use the Pinecone Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Pinecone Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent. You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of this template. Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool# You can connect the Pinecone Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an AI agent to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries. Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store node. Use a retriever to fetch documents# You can use the Vector Store Retriever node with the Pinecone Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Pinecone Vector Store node. This is often used with the Question and Answer Chain node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input. An example of the connection flow would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store. Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions# Another pattern uses the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to summarize results and answer questions from the Pinecone Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Pinecone Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store. The connections flow in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector store. Node parameters# Operation Mode# This Vector Store node has five modes: Get Many, Insert Documents, Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool), Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent), and Update Documents. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available. Get Many# In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context. Insert Documents# Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details. Update Documents# Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the ID with the ID of the embedding entry to update. Get Many parameters# Pinecone Index: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use. Prompt: Enter your search query. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Insert Documents parameters# Pinecone Index: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters# Pinecone Index: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters# Name: The name of the vector store. Description: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often. Pinecone Index: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Node options# Pinecone Namespace# Another segregation option for how to store your data within the index. Metadata Filter# Available in Get Many mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document. This is an AND query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node. Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration. Predefined credential types# A predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node. For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.

Stuck waiting for trigger event# When testing the Google Sheets Trigger node with the Test step or or Test workflow buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas. Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying. To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support. Date and time columns are rendering as numbers# Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways. The serial number format, popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, .5 represents noon). To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when Trigger On is set to Row Added: Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas. Select Add option. Select DateTime Render. Change DateTime Render to Formatted String. The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format. The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings.

    "content": "Looping in n8n# Looping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are some nodes where this isn't true. Using loops in n8n# n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node. Nodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would: Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node. Configure the parameters. Execute the node. You would receive five messages: one for each item. This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop. Executing nodes once# For situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the Execute Once parameter in the Settings tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one. Creating loops# n8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to Node exceptions for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items. Loop until a condition is met# To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an IF node to check when to stop the loop. Here is an example workflow that implements a loop with an IF node: Loop until all items are processed# Use the Loop Over Items node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set Batch Size to 1. You can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items. The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop. Node exceptions# Nodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow: CrateDB executes once for insert and update. Code node in Run Once for All Items mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet. Execute Workflow node in Run Once for All Items mode. HTTP Request: you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time. Microsoft SQL executes once for insert, update, and delete. MongoDB executes once for insert and update. QuestDB executes once for insert. Redis: Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data. RSS Read executes once for the requested URL. TimescaleDB executes once for insert and update."

    "content": "Chat Memory Manager node# The Chat Memory Manager node manages chat message memories within your workflows. Use this node to load, insert, and delete chat messages in an in-memory vector store. This node is useful when you: Can't add a memory node directly. Need to do more complex memory management, beyond what the memory nodes offer. For example, you can add this node to check the memory size of the Agent node's response, and reduce it if needed. Want to inject messages to the AI that look like user messages, to give the AI more context. On this page, you'll find a list of operations that the Chat Memory Manager node supports, along with links to more resources. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node parameters# Operation Mode: Choose between Get Many Messages, Insert Messages, and Delete Messages operations. Insert Mode: Available in Insert Messages mode. Choose from: Insert Messages: Insert messages alongside existing messages. Override All Messages: Replace current memory. Delete Mode: available in Delete Messages mode. Choose from: Last N: Delete the last N messages. All Messages: Delete messages from memory. Chat Messages: available in Insert Messages mode. Define the chat messages to insert into the memory, including: Type Name or ID: Set the message type. Select one of: AI: Use this for messages from the AI. System: Add a message containing instructions for the AI. User: Use this for messages from the user. This message type is sometimes called the 'human' message in other AI tools and guides. Message: Enter the message contents. Hide Message in Chat: Select whether n8n should display the message to the user in the chat UI (turned off) or not (turned on). Messages Count: Available in Delete Messages mode when you select Last N. Enter the number of latest messages to delete. Simplify Output: Available in Get Many Messages mode.

Bad request - please check your parameters# This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the Send Template operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template. To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your message template. Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template. Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the Edit Fields (Set) node or set a fallback value to ensure you send a value with the correct format. Working with non-text media# The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more. If your operation includes a Input Data Field Name or Property Name parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression. For example, if you are trying to send a message with an \"Image\" MessageType and Take Image From set to \"n8n\", set Input Data Field Name to a field name like data instead of an expression like {{ $json.input.data }}."

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/",
    "content": "Handling API rate limits# API rate limits are restrictions on request frequency. For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day. APIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response. Identify rate limit issues# When an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service. If n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is The service is receiving too many requests from you. To check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service. Handle rate limits for integrations# There are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the Loop Over Items and Wait nodes: Retry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts. With Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests. Enable Retry On Fail# When you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time. Open the node. Select Settings. Enable the Retry On Fail toggle. Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set Wait Between Tries (ms) to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set Wait Between Tries (ms) to 1000 to allow a 1 second wait. Use Loop Over Items and Wait# Use the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request. Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to Loop Over Items for information on how to configure the node. Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to Wait for information on how to configure the node. For example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI: Handle rate limits in the HTTP Request node# The HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data. Batch requests# Use the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait. In the HTTP Request node, select Add Option > Batching. Set Items per Batch: this is the number of input items to include in each request. Set Batch Interval (ms) to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set Wait Between Tries (ms) to 1000 to allow a 1 second wait. Paginate results# APIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to HTTP Request node | Pagination."

    "content": "Sustainable Use License# Proprietary licenses for Enterprise Proprietary licenses are available for enterprise customers. Get in touch for more information. n8n's Sustainable Use License and n8n Enterprise License are based on the fair-code model. License FAQs# What license do you use?# n8n uses the Sustainable Use License and n8n Enterprise License. These licenses are based on the fair-code model. What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License?# The Sustainable Use License applies to all our source code hosted in our main GitHub repository except: Content of branches other than master. Source code files that contain .ee. in their file name. These are licensed under the n8n Enterprise License. What is the Sustainable Use License?# The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this here. The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations: You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use. You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes. You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law. We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at license@n8n.io if you would like to ask any questions about it. What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?# Our license restricts use to \"internal business purposes\". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed: White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money. Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it. All of the following examples are allowed under our license: Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database. Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n. Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n. Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server. Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?# Usually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data. Here are two examples to clarify: EXAMPLE 1: SYNC ACME APP WITH HUBSPOT# Bob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot. NOT ALLOWED under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app. EXAMPLE 2: EMBED AI CHATBOT IN ACME APP# Bob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot. ALLOWED under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected. What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?# You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it here. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at the examples, and if you're still unclear, email us at license@n8n.io. Why don't you use an open source license?# n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term. Why did you create a license?# Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license: By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible. By promoting fair-code with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours. Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were: To be as permissive as possible. Safeguarding our ability to build a business. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not. My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n?# Provided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at the examples, and if you're still unclear, email us at license@n8n.io. What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?# Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's terms of use. In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms. n8n asks every contributor to sign our Contributor License Agreement. In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business). It's easy to get started contributing code to n8n here, and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community here. Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?# n8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license. However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction. We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product. What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?# There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to \"sell\" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether. That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here. Is n8n open source?# Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the Open Source Initiative (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source. We coined the term 'fair-code' as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code. What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?# Fair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software: Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody. Has its source code openly available. Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities. Is commercially restricted by its authors. The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses here. We're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email license@n8n.io. Can I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project?# Yes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: license@n8n.io."

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/",
    "content": "Item linking in the Code node# Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to Item linking concepts. This document focuses on practical usage examples. When using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use $(\"<node-name>\").item later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items. These scenarios are when you: Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input. Return new items. Want to manually control the item linking. n8n's automatic item linking handles the other scenarios. To control item linking, set pairedItem when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [ { \"json\": { . . . }, // The index of the input item that generated this output item \"pairedItem\": 0 } ] pairedItem usage example# Take this input data: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 [ { \"id\": \"23423532\", \"name\": \"Jay Gatsby\" }, { \"id\": \"23423533\", \"name\": \"José Arcadio Buendía\" }, { \"id\": \"23423534\", \"name\": \"Max Sendak\" }, { \"id\": \"23423535\", \"name\": \"Zaphod Beeblebrox\" }, { \"id\": \"23423536\", \"name\": \"Edmund Pevensie\" } ] And use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 newItems = []; for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){ newItems.push( { \"json\": { \"name\": items[i].json.name, \"aBrandNewField\": \"New data for item \" + i } } ) } return newItems; newItems is an array of items with no pairedItem. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them. Add the pairedItem object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 newItems = []; for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){ newItems.push( { \"json\": { \"name\": items[i].json.name, \"aBrandNewField\": \"New data for item \" + i }, \"pairedItem\": i } ) } return newItems; Each new item now links to the item used to create it."

When building your own nodes, you must still make sure the node returns data with the json key. Data item processing# Nodes can process multiple items. For example, if you set the Trello node to Create-Card, and create an expression that sets Name using a property called name-input-value from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the name-input-value of the current item. For example, this input will create two cards. One named test1 the other one named test2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [ { name-input-value: \"test1\" }, { name-input-value: \"test2\" } ]"

There are two available options for doing so: Solution Pros Cons Create a workflow for each user No limitation on how workflow starts (can use any trigger) Requires managing multiple workflows. Create a single workflow, and pass it user credentials when executing Simplified workflow management (only need to change one workflow). To run the workflow, your product must call it Warning The APIs referenced in this document are subject to change at any time. Be sure the check for continued functionality with each version upgrade. Workflow per user# There are three general steps to follow: Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow. Create the n8n credentials for this user. Create the workflow. 1. Obtain user credentials# Here you need to capture all credentials for any node/service this user must authenticate with, along with any additional parameters required for the particular workflow. The credentials and any parameters needed will depend on your workflow and what you are trying to do. 2. Create user credentials# After all relevant credential details have been obtained, you can proceed to create the relevant service credentials in n8n. This can be done using the Editor UI or API call. Using the Editor UI# From the menu select Credentials > New. Use the drop-down to select the Credential type to create, for example Airtable. In the Create New Credentials modal, enter the corresponding credentials details for the user, and select the nodes that will have access to these credentials. Click Create to finish and save. Using the API# The frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials. For example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be: 1 POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials With the request body: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { \"name\":\"MyAirtable\", \"type\":\"airtableApi\", \"nodesAccess\":[ { \"nodeType\":\"n8n-nodes-base.airtable\" } ], \"data\":{ \"apiKey\":\"q12we34r5t67yu\" } } The response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 { \"data\":{ \"name\":\"MyAirtable\", \"type\":\"airtableApi\", \"data\":{ \"apiKey\":\"q12we34r5t67yu\" }, \"nodesAccess\":[ { \"nodeType\":\"n8n-nodes-base.airtable\", \"date\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.770Z\" } ], \"id\":\"29\", \"createdAt\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z\", \"updatedAt\":\"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z\" } } 3. Create the workflow# Best practice is to have a “base” workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details). You can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call. Using the Editor UI# From the menu select Workflows > Open to open the template workflow to be duplicated. Select Workflows > Duplicate, then enter a name for this new workflow and click Save. Update all relevant nodes to use the credentials for this user (created above). Save this workflow set it to Active using the toggle in the top-right corner. Using the API# Fetch the JSON of the template workflow using the endpoint: https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/<workflow_id> 1 GET https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/1012 The response will contain the JSON data of the selected workflow: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 { \"data\": { \"id\": \"1012\", \"name\": \"Nathan's Workflow\", \"active\": false, \"nodes\": [ { \"parameters\": {}, \"name\": \"Start\", \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.start\", \"typeVersion\": 1, \"position\": [ 130, 640 ] }, { \"parameters\": { \"authentication\": \"headerAuth\", \"url\": \"https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/webhook/custom-erp\", \"options\": { \"splitIntoItems\": true }, \"headerParametersUi\": { \"parameter\": [ { \"name\": \"unique_id\", \"value\": \"recLhLYQbzNSFtHNq\" } ] } }, \"name\": \"HTTP Request\", \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest\", \"typeVersion\": 1, \"position\": [ 430, 300 ], \"credentials\": { \"httpHeaderAuth\": \"beginner_course\" } }, { \"parameters\": { \"operation\": \"append\", \"application\": \"appKBGQfbm6NfW6bv\", \"table\": \"processingOrders\", \"options\": {} }, \"name\": \"Airtable\", \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.airtable\", \"typeVersion\": 1, \"position\": [ 990, 210 ], \"credentials\": { \"airtableApi\": \"Airtable\" } }, { \"parameters\": { \"conditions\": { \"string\": [ { \"value1\": \"={{$json[\\\"orderStatus\\\"]}}\", \"value2\": \"processing\" } ] } }, \"name\": \"IF\", \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.if\", \"typeVersion\": 1, \"position\": [ 630, 300 ] }, { \"parameters\": { \"keepOnlySet\": true, \"values\": { \"number\": [ { \"name\": \"=orderId\", \"value\": \"={{$json[\\\"orderID\\\"]}}\" } ], \"string\": [ { \"name\": \"employeeName\", \"value\": \"={{$json[\\\"employeeName\\\"]}}\" } ] }, \"options\": {} }, \"name\": \"Set\", \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.set\", \"typeVersion\": 1, \"position\": [ 800, 210 ] }, { \"parameters\": { \"functionCode\": \"let totalBooked = items.length;\\nlet bookedSum = 0;\\n\\nfor(let i=0; i < items.length; i++) {\\n bookedSum = bookedSum + items[i].json.orderPrice;\\n}\\nreturn [{json:{totalBooked, bookedSum}}]\\n\" }, \"name\": \"Function\", \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.function\", \"typeVersion\": 1, \"position\": [ 800, 400 ] }, { \"parameters\": { \"webhookUri\": \"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/865213348202151968/oD5_WPDQwtr22Vjd_82QP3-_4b_lGhAeM7RynQ8Js5DzyXrQEnj0zeAQIA6fki1JLtXE\", \"text\": \"=This week we have {{$json[\\\"totalBooked\\\"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json[\\\"bookedSum\\\"]}}.

Create the workflow# The details and scope of this workflow will vary greatly according to the individual use case, however there are a few design implementations to keep in mind: This workflow must be triggered by a Webhook node. The incoming webhook call must contain the user’s credentials and any other workflow parameters required.

Save and activate the workflow, ensuring the production URL is selected for the Webhook node. Refer to webhook node for more information. Call the workflow# For each new user, or for any existing user as may be needed, call the webhook defined as the workflow trigger and provide the necessary credentials (and any other workflow parameters)."

Limit sets the maximum number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide. In the Query Options section, you can activate the following parameters: Query lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: {\"status\": \"success\", \"_submission_time\": {\"$lt\": \"2021-11-01T01:02:03\"}} queries for all submissions with the value success for the field status, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03. Fields lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter. Sort lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, {\"status\": 1, \"_submission_time\": -1} specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time. More details about these options can be found in the Formhub API docs Submission options# All operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include: Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images). Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in About reformatting. About reformatting# The default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings. This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the Reformat? parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations. When enabled, the reformatting: Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a / character in the field names, for example Group1/Question1. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into Group1.Question1, as nested JSON objects. Renames fields to trim _ (not supported by many downstream systems). Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent. Splits all fields matching any of the Multiselect Mask wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the * wildcard. Converts all fields matching any of the Number Mask wildcard masks into a JSON float. Here's a detailed example in JSON: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 { \"_id\": 471987, \"formhub/uuid\": \"189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6\", \"start\": \"2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00\", \"end\": \"2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00\", \"Field_Details/Field_Name\": \"Test Fields\", \"Field_Details/Field_Location\": \"-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165\", \"Field_Details/Field_Shape\": \"-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165;-1.933011 30.078085 0 0;-1.933257 30.078004 0 0;-1.933338 30.078197 0 0;-1.933107 30.078299 0 0;-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165\", \"Field_Details/Crops_Grown\": \"maize beans avocado\", \"Field_Details/Field_Size_sqm\": \"2300\", \"__version__\": \"veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs\", \"meta/instanceID\": \"uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\", \"_xform_id_string\": \"ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm\", \"_uuid\": \"2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\", \"_attachments\": [], \"_status\": \"submitted_via_web\", \"_geolocation\": [ -1.932914, 30.078211 ], \"_submission_time\": \"2021-12-05T14:15:44\", \"_tags\": [], \"_notes\": [], \"_validation_status\": {}, \"_submitted_by\": null } With reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, Crops_* and *_sqm respectively), n8n parses it into: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 { \"id\": 471987, \"formhub\": { \"uuid\": \"189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6\" }, \"start\": \"2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00\", \"end\": \"2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00\", \"Field_Details\": { \"Field_Name\": \"Test Fields\", \"Field_Location\": { \"lat\": -1.932914, \"lon\": 30.078211 }, \"Field_Shape\": { \"type\": \"polygon\", \"coordinates\": [ { \"lat\": -1.932914, \"lon\": 30.078211 }, { \"lat\": -1.933011, \"lon\": 30.078085 }, { \"lat\": -1.933257, \"lon\": 30.078004 }, { \"lat\": -1.933338, \"lon\": 30.078197 }, { \"lat\": -1.933107, \"lon\": 30.078299 }, { \"lat\": -1.932914, \"lon\": 30.078211 } ] }, \"Crops_Grown\": [ \"maize\", \"beans\", \"avocado\" ], \"Field_Size_sqm\": 2300 }, \"version\": \"veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs\", \"meta\": { \"instanceID\": \"uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\" }, \"xform_id_string\": \"ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm\", \"uuid\": \"2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\", \"attachments\": [], \"status\": \"submitted_via_web\", \"geolocation\": { \"lat\": -1.932914, \"lon\": 30.078211 }, \"submission_time\": \"2021-12-05T14:15:44\", \"tags\": [], \"notes\": [], \"validation_status\": {}, \"submitted_by\": null } What to do if your operation isn't supported# If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the HTTP Request node to call the service's API.

Processing parameters# The OpenAI Chat Model node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name.

Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Check the organization-level billing overview page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page. Check the organization-level usage limits page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the Usage limits section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.

GDPR for self-hosted users# If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE environment variable. Refer to Environment variables for more information. Data collection# n8n collects selected usage and performance data to help diagnose problems and improve the platform. Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the privacy policy. The data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud. Data collection in self-hosted n8n# n8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data. What n8n collects# Error codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes) Error reports for app crashes and API issues The graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected) From node parameters: The 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable) For HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized) Data around workflow executions: Status The user ID of the user who ran the execution The first time a workflow loads data from an external source The first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution The domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain). Details on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches) Diagnostic information: n8n version Selected settings: DB_TYPE N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS Execution variables OS, RAM, and CPUs Anonymous instance ID IP address What n8n doesn't collect# n8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as: Personally identifiable information (except IP address) Credential information Node parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation') Execution data Sensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password) Error payloads How collection works# Most data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours). Opting out of telemetry# Telemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables. To opt out of telemetry events: 1 export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n: 1 export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false See configuration for more info on how to set environment variables. Data collection in n8n Cloud# n8n Cloud collects everything listed in Data collection in self-hosted n8n. Additionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses PostHog to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days. AI in n8n# To provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs). How n8n uses AI# To assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days. When n8n shares data# Data is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs. What n8n shares# General Workflow Information: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active. Input & Output Schemas of Nodes: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema. Node Configuration: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node. Code and Expressions: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations. What n8n doesn't share# Credentials: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes. Output Data: The actual data processed by your workflows. Sensitive Information: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a Code Node. Documentation telemetry# n8n's documentation (this website) uses cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of n8n's documentation and whether users find what they're searching for. With your consent, you're helping n8n to make our documentation better. Change cookie settings Retention and deletion of personal identifiable data# PID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual. n8n Cloud# PID retention# n8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service. For n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according to the retention rules on your account. n8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 90 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations. PID deletion# If you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 90 days. Self-hosted# Self-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to What you can do for more information. Payment processor# n8n uses Paddle.com to process payments. When you sign up for a paid plan, Paddle transmits and stores the details of your payment method according to their security policy. n8n stores no information about your payment method."

They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows. Built-in nodes# n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to Built-in nodes for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes. Community nodes# As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to Community nodes for more information. Credential-only nodes and custom operations# One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. n8n provides credentials support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes. Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node. Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration. Refer to Custom operations for more information. Generic integrations# If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the HTTP Request node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call. Where to go next# If you want to create your own node, head over to the Creating Nodes section. Check out Community nodes to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes. If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: Core nodes, Actions, and Triggers.

    "h1": "Build a declarative-style node#",
    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/",
    "content": "Build a declarative-style node# This tutorial walks through building a declarative-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to Choose your node building approach for more information. Prerequisites# You need the following installed on your development machine: git Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL here. For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to Install NodeJS on Windows. You need some understanding of: JavaScript/TypeScript REST APIs git Build your node# In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the NASA API. You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint. Existing node n8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name. Step 1: Set up the project# n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter. Clone the repository and navigate into the directory: Generate a new repository from the template repository. Clone your new repository: 1 2 git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics cd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files: nodes/ExampleNode nodes/HTTPBin credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts Now create the following directories and files: nodes/NasaPics nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts These are the key files required for any node. Refer to Node file structure for more information on required files and recommended organization. Now install the project dependencies: 1 npm i Step 2: Add an icon# Save the NASA SVG logo from here as nasapics.svg in nodes/NasaPics/. n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio. Don't reference Font Awesome If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image. Step 3: Create the node# Every node must have a base file. Refer to Node base file for detailed information about base file parameters. In this example, the file is NasaPics.node.ts. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to Node file structure for more information. Step 3.1: Imports# Start by adding the import statements: 1 import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow'; Step 3.2: Create the main class# The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a description interface, which in turn contains the properties array. Class names and file names Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class NasaPics, the filename must be NasaPics.node.ts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 export class NasaPics implements INodeType { description: INodeTypeDescription = { // Basic node details will go here properties: [ // Resources and operations will go here ] }; } Step 3.3: Add node details# All nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the description: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 displayName: 'NASA Pics', name: 'NasaPics', icon: 'file:nasapics.svg', group: ['transform'], version: 1, subtitle: '={{$parameter[\"operation\"] + \": \" + $parameter[\"resource\"]}}', description: 'Get data from NASAs API', defaults: { name: 'NASA Pics', }, inputs: ['main'], outputs: ['main'], credentials: [ { name: 'NasaPicsApi', required: true, }, ], requestDefaults: { baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov', headers: { Accept: 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }, }, n8n uses some of the properties set in description to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are displayName, icon, description, and subtitle. Step 3.4: Add resources# The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: planetary/apod and mars-photos. This means you need to define two resource options in NasaPics.node.ts. Update the properties array with the resource object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 properties: [ { displayName: 'Resource', name: 'resource', type: 'options', noDataExpression: true, options: [ { name: 'Astronomy Picture of the Day', value: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', }, { name: 'Mars Rover Photos', value: 'marsRoverPhotos', }, ], default: 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', }, // Operations will go here ] type controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. options results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to Node UI elements for more information. Step 3.5: Add operations# The operations object defines the available operations on a resource. In a declarative-style node, the operations object includes routing (within the options array). This sets up the details of the API call. Add the following to the properties array, after the resource object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 { displayName: 'Operation', name: 'operation', type: 'options', noDataExpression: true, displayOptions: { show: { resource: [ 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', ], }, }, options: [ { name: 'Get', value: 'get', action: 'Get the APOD', description: 'Get the Astronomy Picture of the day', routing: { request: { method: 'GET', url: '/planetary/apod', }, }, }, ], default: 'get', }, { displayName: 'Operation', name: 'operation', type: 'options', noDataExpression: true, displayOptions: { show: { resource: [ 'marsRoverPhotos', ], }, }, options: [ { name: 'Get', value: 'get', action: 'Get Mars Rover photos', description: 'Get photos from the Mars Rover', routing: { request: { method: 'GET', }, }, }, ], default: 'get', }, { displayName: 'Rover name', description: 'Choose which Mars Rover to get a photo from', required: true, name: 'roverName', type: 'options', options: [ {name: 'Curiosity', value: 'curiosity'}, {name: 'Opportunity', value: 'opportunity'}, {name: 'Perseverance', value: 'perseverance'}, {name: 'Spirit', value: 'spirit'}, ], routing: { request: { url: '=/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/{{$value}}/photos', }, }, default: 'curiosity', displayOptions: { show: { resource: [ 'marsRoverPhotos', ], }, }, }, { displayName: 'Date', description: 'Earth date', required: true, name: 'marsRoverDate', type: 'dateTime', default:'', displayOptions: { show: { resource: [ 'marsRoverPhotos', ], }, }, routing: { request: { // You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string qs: { earth_date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}', }, }, }, }, // Optional/additional fields will go here This code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named roverName requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The routing object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call. Step 3.6: Optional fields# Most APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query. To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under Additional Fields in the UI. For this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 { displayName: 'Additional Fields', name: 'additionalFields', type: 'collection', default: {}, placeholder: 'Add Field', displayOptions: { show: { resource: [ 'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', ], operation: [ 'get', ], }, }, options: [ { displayName: 'Date', name: 'apodDate', type: 'dateTime', default: '', routing: { request: { // You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string qs: { date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}', }, }, }, }, ], } Step 4: Set up authentication# The NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key. Add the following to nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 import { IAuthenticateGeneric, ICredentialType, INodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow'; export class NasaPicsApi implements ICredentialType { name = 'NasaPicsApi'; displayName = 'NASA Pics API'; // Uses the link to this tutorial as an example // Replace with your own docs links when building your own nodes documentationUrl = 'https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/'; properties: INodeProperties[] = [ { displayName: 'API Key', name: 'apiKey', type: 'string', default: '', }, ]; authenticate = { type: 'generic', properties: { qs: { 'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}' } }, } as IAuthenticateGeneric; } For more information about credentials files and options, refer to Credentials file. Step 5: Add node metadata# Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is NasaPics.node.json. Add the following code to the JSON file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 { \"node\": \"n8n-nodes-base.NasaPics\", \"nodeVersion\": \"1.0\", \"codexVersion\": \"1.0\", \"categories\": [ \"Miscellaneous\" ], \"resources\": { \"credentialDocumentation\": [ { \"url\": \"\" } ], \"primaryDocumentation\": [ { \"url\": \"\" } ] } } For more information on these parameters, refer to Node codex files. Step 6: Update the npm package details# Your npm package details are in the package.json at the root of the project. It's essential to include the n8n object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 { // All node names must start with \"n8n-nodes-\" \"name\": \"n8n-nodes-nasapics\", \"version\": \"0.1.0\", \"description\": \"n8n node to call NASA's APOD and Mars Rover Photo services.\", \"keywords\": [ // This keyword is required for community nodes \"n8n-community-node-package\" ], \"license\": \"MIT\", \"homepage\": \"https://n8n.io\", \"author\": { \"name\": \"Test\", \"email\": \"test@example.com\" }, \"repository\": { \"type\": \"git\", // Change the git remote to your own repository // Add the new URL here \"url\": \"git+<your-repo-url>\" }, \"main\": \"index.js\", \"scripts\": { // don't change }, \"files\": [ \"dist\" ], // Link the credentials and node \"n8n\": { \"n8nNodesApiVersion\": 1, \"credentials\": [ \"dist/credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.js\" ], \"nodes\": [ \"dist/nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.js\" ] }, \"devDependencies\": { // don't change }, \"peerDependencies\": { // don't change } } You need to update the package.json to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm package.json files, refer to npm's package.json documentation. Test your node# You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance. Install n8n using npm: 1 npm install n8n -g When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally: 1 2 3 # In your node directory npm run build npm link Install the node into your local n8n instance: 1 2 3 # In the nodes directory within your n8n installation # node-package-name is the name from the package.json npm link <node-package-name> Check your directory Make sure you run npm link <node-name> in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be: ~/.n8n/custom/ ~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>: if your n8n installation set a different name using N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS. Start n8n: 1 n8n start Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel. Node names Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is n8n-nodes-weather-nodes, and the package contains nodes named rain, sun, snow, you should search for rain, not weather-nodes. Troubleshooting# There's no custom directory in ~/.n8n local installation. You have to create custom directory manually and run npm init 1 2 3 4 # In ~/.n8n directory run mkdir custom cd custom npm init Next steps# Deploy your node.

    "content": "External secrets# Feature availability External secrets are available on Enterprise Self-hosted and Enterprise Cloud plans. n8n supports AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager, Infisical and HashiCorp Vault. n8n doesn't support HashiCorp Vault Secrets. You can use an external secrets store to manage credentials for n8n. n8n stores all credentials encrypted in its database, and restricts access to them by default. With the external secrets feature, you can store sensitive credential information in an external vault, and have n8n load it in when required. This provides an extra layer of security and allows you to manage credentials used across multiple n8n environments in one central place. Connect n8n to your secrets store# Secret names Your secret names can't contain spaces, hyphens, or other special characters. n8n supports secret names containing alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9), and underscores. In n8n, go to Settings > External Secrets. Select Set Up for your store provider. Enter the credentials for your provider: Azure Key Vault: Provide your vault name, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. Refer to the Azure documentation to register a Microsoft Entra ID app and create a service principal. n8n supports only single-line values for secrets. AWS Secrets Manager: provide your access key ID, secret access key, and region. The IAM user must have the secretsmanager:ListSecrets, secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue, and secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permissions. To give n8n access to all secrets in your AWS Secrets Manager, you can attach the following policy to the IAM user: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"AccessAllSecrets\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:ListSecrets\", \"secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue\", \"secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy\", \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\", \"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret\", \"secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds\", ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } You can also be more restrictive and give n8n access to select specific AWS Secret Manager secrets. You still need to allow the secretsmanager:ListSecrets and secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue permissions to access all resources. These permissions allow n8n to retrieve ARN-scoped secrets, but don't provide access to the secret values. Next, you need set the scope for the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to the specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the secrets you wish to share with n8n. Ensure you use the correct region and account ID in each resource ARNs. You can find the ARN details in the AWS dashboard for your secrets. For example, the following IAM policy only allows access to secrets with a name starting with n8n in your specified AWS account and region: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"ListingSecrets\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:ListSecrets\", \"secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" }, { \"Sid\": \"RetrievingSecrets\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\", \"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret\" ], \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789000:secret:n8n*\" ] } ] } For more IAM permission policy examples, consult the AWS documentation. HashiCorp Vault: provide the Vault URL for your vault instance, and select your Authentication Method. Enter your authentication details. Optionally provide a namespace. Refer to the HashiCorp documentation for your authentication method: Token auth method AppRole auth method Userpass auth method If you use vault namespaces, you can enter the namespace n8n should connect to. Refer to Vault Enterprise namespaces for more information on HashiCorp Vault namespaces. Infisical: provide a Service Token. Refer to Infisical's Service token documentation for information on getting your token. If you self-host Infisical, enter the Site URL. Infisical environment Make sure you select the correct Infisical environment when creating your token. n8n will load secrets from this environment, and won't have access to secrets in other Infisical environments. n8n only support service tokens that have access to a single environment. Infisical folders n8n doesn't support Infisical folders. Google Cloud Platform: provide a Service Account Key (JSON) for a service account that has at least these roles: Secret Manager Secret Accessor and Secret Manager Secret Viewer. Refer to Google's service account documentation for more information. Save your configuration. Enable the provider using the Disabled / Enabled toggle. Use secrets in n8n credentials# To use a secret from your store in an n8n credential: Create a new credential, or open an existing one. On the field where you want to use a secret: Hover over the field. Select Expression. In the field where you want to use a secret, enter an expression referencing the secret name: 1 {{ $secrets.<vault-name>.<secret-name> }} <vault-name> is either vault (for HashiCorp) or infisical or awsSecretsManager. Replace <secret-name> with the name as it appears in your vault. Using external secrets with n8n environments# n8n's Source control and environments feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment. For example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance. Using external secrets in projects# To use external secrets in an RBAC project, you must have an instance owner or instance admin as a member of the project. Troubleshooting# Infisical version changes# Infisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io. Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin# Due to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production. Only use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production."

Depending on the problem with the JSON object, the error sometimes display as The 'JSON Output' in item 0 does not contain a valid JSON object. To resolve this, make sure that the code you provide is valid JSON: Check the JSON with a JSON validator. Check that your JSON object doesn't reference undefined input data. This may occur if the incoming data doesn't always include the same fields. Can't get data for expression# This error occurs when n8n can't retrieve the data referenced by an expression. Often, this happens when the preceding node hasn't been run yet. Another variation of this may appear as Referenced node is unexecuted. In that case, the full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format: An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first. To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node. For nodes that use JavaScript or other custom code, you can check if a previous node has executed before trying to use its value by checking the following: 1 $(\"<node-name>\").isExecuted As an example, this JSON references the parameters of the input data. This error will display if you test this step without connecting it to another node: 1 2 3 { \"my_field_1\": {{ $input.params }} } Invalid syntax# This error occurs when you use an expression that has a syntax error.

If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically. Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this. This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to Choose your node building approach for more information on node styles. Start by reading Item linking concepts, which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically. If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting pairedItem on each item your node returns: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 // Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item newItem = { \"json\": { . . . }, \"pairedItem\": { \"item\": item.pairedItem, // Optional: choose the input to use // Set this if your node combines multiple inputs \"input\": 0 }; // Or set the index manually newItem = { \"json\": { . . . } \"pairedItem\": { \"item\": i, // Optional: choose the input to use // Set this if your node combines multiple inputs \"input\": 0 }, };"

The node requires scopes for the conversations.list and users.list methods at minimum. Check out the Scopes | Slack credentials list for a more complete list of scopes. Common issues# Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Workflow only works in testing or production# Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL. You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications. To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing: Halts production traffic This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated. Go to your workflow page. Toggle the Active switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily. Edit the Request URL in your the Slack Trigger configuration to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL. When you finish testing, edit the Request URL in your the Slack Trigger configuration to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL. Toggle the Inactive toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working. Token expired# Slack offers token rotation that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be off. To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation. If your app uses token rotation Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead."

If you want n8n to highlight your post on the blog, follow these steps: Email your idea to marketing@n8n.io with the subject \"Blog contribution: [Your Topic].\" Submit your draft: Write your post in a Google Doc following the style guide. If your blog post includes example workflows, include the workflow JSON in a separate section at the end. For author credit, provide a second Google Doc with your full name, a short byline, and your image. n8n will use this to create your author page and credit you as the author of the post. Wait for feedback. We will respond if your draft fits with the blog's strategy and requirements. If you don't hear back within 30 days, it means we won't be moving forward with your blog post. Refer a candidate# Do you know someone who would be a great fit for one of our open positions? Refer them to us! In return, we'll pay you €1,000 when the referral successfully passes their probationary period. Here's how this works: Search: Have a look at the description and requirements of each role, and consider if someone you know would be a great fit. Referral: Once you've identified a potential candidate, send an email to Jobs at n8n with the subject line Employee referral - [job title] and a short description of the person you're referring (and the reason why). Also, tell your referral to apply for the job through our careers page. Evaluation: We'll screen the application and inform you about the next steps of the hiring process. Reward: As soon as your referral has successfully finished the probationary period, we'll reward you for your efforts by transferring the €1,000 to your bank account."

    "content": "External storage# Feature availability Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, contact n8n. n8n can store binary data produced by workflow executions externally. This feature is useful to avoid relying on the filesystem for storing large amounts of binary data. n8n will introduce external storage for other data types in the future. Storing n8n's binary data in S3# n8n supports AWS S3 as an external store for binary data produced by workflow executions. You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these. Enterprise-tier feature You will need an Enterprise license key for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket. Setup# Create and configure a bucket following the AWS documentation. You can use the following policy, replacing <bucket-name> with the name of the bucket you created: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [\"s3:*\"], \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>\", \"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*\"] } ] } Set a bucket-level lifecycle configuration so that S3 automatically deletes old binary data. n8n delegates pruning of binary data to S3, so setting a lifecycle configuration is required unless you want to preserve binary data indefinitely. Once you finish creating the bucket, you will have a host, bucket name and region, and an access key ID and secret access key. You need to set them in n8n's environment: 1 2 3 4 5 export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_HOST=... # example: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_SECRET=... No region If your provider doesn't require a region, you can set N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION to 'auto'. Tell n8n to store binary data in S3: 1 2 export N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES=filesystem,s3 export N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=s3 Restart the server to load the new configuration. Usage# After you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format: 1 workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/binary_data/{binaryFileId} n8n continues to read older binary data stored in the filesystem from the filesystem, if filesystem remains listed as an option in N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES. If you store binary data in S3 and later switch to filesystem mode, the instance continues to read any data stored in S3, as long as s3 remains listed in N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES and your S3 credentials remain valid. Binary data pruning Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future."

You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. For example, n8n's Gmail node uses loadOptions to get all email labels: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 methods = { loadOptions: { // Get all the labels and display them async getLabels( this: ILoadOptionsFunctions, ): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> { const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = []; const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call( this, 'labels', 'GET', '/gmail/v1/users/me/labels', ); for (const label of labels) { const labelName = label.name; const labelId = label.id; returnData.push({ name: labelName, value: labelId, }); } return returnData; }, }, }; version# Number or Array | Optional Use version when using the light versioning approach. If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version. n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Google Gemini Chat Model node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node parameters# Model: Select the model to use to generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads models from the Google Gemini API and you'll only see the models available to your account. Node options# Maximum Number of Tokens: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length. Sampling Temperature: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations. Top K: Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token. Top P: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options. Safety Settings: Gemini supports adjustable safety settings.

    "h1": "Processing different data types#",
    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-two/chapter-2/",
    "content": "Processing different data types# In this chapter, you will learn how to process different types of data using n8n core nodes. HTML and XML data# You're most likely familiar with HTML and XML. HTML vs. XML HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and semantics of a web page. XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold. If you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the HTML node or the XML node. Use the HTML node to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping). HTML Exercise# Let's get the title of the latest n8n blog post: Use the HTTP Request node to make a GET request to the URL https://blog.n8n.io/ (this endpoint requires no authentication). Connect an HTML node and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page. Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector .post .item-title a should help! Show me the solution Use the XML node to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML. This operation is useful if you work with different web services that use either XML or JSON and need to get and submit data between them in the two formats. XML Exercise# In the final exercise of Chapter 1, you used an HTTP Request node to make a request to the PokéAPI. In this exercise, we'll return to that same API but we'll convert the output to XML: Add an HTTP Request node that makes the same request to the PokéAPI at https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon. Use the XML node to convert the JSON output to XML. Show me the solution Date, time, and interval data# Date and time data types include DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, and YEAR. The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example: DATE: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29 TIME: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30 DATETIME: 2022/03/29 08:30:00 TIMESTAMP: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp) YEAR: 2022, 22 There are a few ways you can work with dates and times: Use the Date & Time node to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates. Use Schedule Trigger node to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration. Sometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node. If you run into situations like this, use the Wait node after the node that you want to delay. The Wait node pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution: At a specific time. After a specified time interval. On a webhook call. Date Exercise# Build a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before setting the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes. To begin: Add the Customer Datastore (n8n training) node with the Get All People action selected. Return All. Add the Date & Time node to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields. Add the If node to check if that new rounded date is after 1960-01-01 00:00:00. Add the Wait node to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute. Add the Edit Fields (Set) node to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields. Add the Schedule Trigger node at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the Manual Trigger node for testing!) Show me the solution Binary data# Up to now, you have mainly worked with text data. But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form. In n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes: HTTP Request to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs. Read/Write Files from Disk to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running. Convert to File to take input data and output it as a file. Extract From File to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON. Reading and writing files is only available on self-hosted n8n Reading and writing files to disk isn't available on n8n Cloud. You'll read and write to the machine where you installed n8n. If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host. The Read/Write Files From Disk node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors. To read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's File(s) Selector parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's File Path and Name parameter (for the Write operation). Naming the right path The file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n: npm: ~/my_file.json n8n cloud / Docker: /tmp/my_file.json Binary Exercise 1# For our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON: Make an HTTP request to get this PDF file: https://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_Whitepaper_Anti_blocker.pdf. Use the Extract From File node to convert the file from binary to JSON. Show me the solution Binary Exercise 2# For our second binary exercise, let's convert some JSON data to binary: Make an HTTP request to the Poetry DB API https://poetrydb.org/random/1. Convert the returned data from JSON to binary using the Convert to File node. Write the new binary file data to the machine where n8n is running using the Read/Write Files From Disk node. To check that it worked out, use the Read/Write Files From Disk node to read the generated binary file. Show me the solution"

Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud. Latest and Next versions n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum. Current latest: 1.86.1 Current next: 1.88.0 Create a server# Log in to the Hetzner Cloud Console. Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting + NEW PROJECT. Select + CREATE SERVER on the project tile you want to add it to. You can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the Image section, select \"Docker CE\" from the APPS tab. Type When creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough. SSH keys Hetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH. Log in to your server# The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project. Install Docker Compose# The Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands: 1 2 apt update && apt -y upgrade apt install docker-compose-plugin Clone configuration repository# Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from this repository into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make. Clone the repository with the following command: 1 git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned: 1 cd n8n-docker-caddy Default folders and files# The host operating system (the server) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are: caddy_config: Holds the Caddy configuration files. local_files: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n. Create Docker volume# To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create a Docker volume that Docker reuses between restarts: 1 docker volume create caddy_data Create a Docker volume for the n8n data: 1 sudo docker volume create n8n_data Set up DNS# n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the server. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new \"A\" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts. Open ports# n8n runs as a web application, so the server needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic. Open the following ports in the server's firewall by running the following two commands: 1 2 sudo ufw allow 80 sudo ufw allow 443 Configure n8n# n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example .env file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own. Open the file with the following command: 1 nano .env The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details. The Docker Compose file# The Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n. The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers. The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the .env file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers. The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the .env file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command: 1 nano docker-compose.yml Configure Caddy# Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the Caddyfile file in the caddy_config folder. 1 nano caddy_config/Caddyfile Change the placeholder subdomain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to n8n.example.com. The n8n in the reverse_proxy setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the docker-compose.yml file: 1 2 3 4 5 n8n.<domain>.<suffix> { reverse_proxy n8n:5678 { flush_interval -1 } } Start Docker Compose# Start n8n and Caddy with the following command: 1 docker compose up -d This may take a few minutes. Test your setup# In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n. Stop n8n and Caddy# You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command: 1 sudo docker compose stop Updating# If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Pull latest version docker compose pull # Stop and remove older version docker compose down # Start the container docker compose up -d Next steps# Learn more about configuring and scaling n8n.

This section applies to workflows using the v0 (legacy) workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your workflow settings. If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing. One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream. For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the true output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the false data stream.

    "content": "Build an AI chat agent with n8n# Welcome to the introductory tutorial for building AI workflows with n8n. Whether you have used n8n before, or this is your first time, we will show you how the building blocks of AI workflows fit together and construct a working AI-powered chat agent which you can easily customize for your own purposes. Many people find it easier to take in new information in video format. This tutorial is based on one of n8n's popular videos, linked below. Watch the video or read the steps here, or both! What you will need# n8n: For this tutorial we recommend using the n8n cloud service - there is a free trial for new users! For a self hosted service, refer to the installation pages. Credentials for a chat model: This tutorial uses OpenAI, but you can easily use DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Groq, Azure, and others (see the sub-nodes documentation for more). What you will learn# AI concepts in n8n How to use the AI Agent node Working with Chat input Connecting with AI models Customising input Observing the conversation Adding persistence AI concepts in n8n# If you're already familiar with AI, feel free to skip this section. This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows. An AI agent builds on Large Language Models (LLMs), which generate text based on input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce output, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use tools, process their outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems. In n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections. Feature LLM AI Agent Core Capability Text generation Goal-oriented task completion Decision-Making None Yes Uses Tools/APIs No Yes Workflow Complexity Single-step Multi-step Scope Generates language Performs complex, real-world tasks Example LLM generating a paragraph An agent scheduling an appointment By incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the content of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent. 1. Create a new workflow# When you open n8n, you'll see either: An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow. The Workflows list on the Overview page. Select the button to create a new workflow. 2. Add a trigger node# Every workflow needs somewhere to start. In n8n these are called 'trigger nodes'. For this workflow, we want to start with a chat node. Select Add first step or press Tab to open the node menu. Search for Chat Trigger. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search. Select Chat Trigger to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node. Close the node details view (Select Back to canvas) to return to the canvas. More about the Chat Trigger node... View workflow file 3. Add an AI Agent Node# The AI Agent node is the core of adding AI to your workflows. Select the Add node connector on the trigger node to bring up the node search. Start typing \"AI\" and choose the AI agent node to add it. The editing view of the AI agent will now be displayed. There are some fields which can be changed. As we're using the Chat Trigger node, the default setting for the source and specification of the prompt don't need to be changed. View workflow file 4. Configure the node# AI agents require a chat model to be attached to process the incoming prompts. Add a chat model by clicking the plus button underneath the Chat Model connection on the AI Agent node (it's the first connection along the bottom of the node). The search dialog will appear, filtered on 'Language Models'. These are the models with built-in support in n8n. For this tutorial we will use OpenAI Chat Model. Selecting the OpenAI Chat model from the list will attach it to the AI Agent node and open the node editor. One of the parameters which can be changed is the 'Model'. Note that for the basic OpenAI accounts, only the 'gpt-4o-mini' model is allowed. Which chat model? 5. Add credentials (if needed)# In order for n8n to communicate with the chat model, it will need some credentials (login data giving it access to an account on a different online service). If you already have credentials set up for OpenAI, these should appear by default in the credentials selector. Otherwise you can use the Credentials selector to help you add a new credential. To add a new credential, click on the text which says 'Select credential'. An option to add a new credential will appear This credential just needs an API key. When adding credentials of any type, check the text to the right-hand side. In this case it has a handy link to take you straight to your OpenAI account to retrieve the API key. The API key is just one long string. That's all you need for this particular credential. Copy it from the OpenAI website and paste it into the API key section. Keeping your credentials safe 6. Test the node# Now that the node is connected to the Chat Trigger and a chat model, we can test this part of the workflow. Click on the 'Chat' button near the bottom of the canvas. This opens up a local chat window on the left and the AI agent logs on the right. Type in a message and press Enter. You will now see the response from the chat model appear below your message. The log window displays the inputs to and outputs from the AI Agent. Accessing the logs... 7. Changing the prompt# The logs in the previous step reveal some extra data - the system prompt. This is the default message that the AI Agent primes the chat model with. From the log you can see this is set to \"You are a helpful assistant\". We can however change this prompt to alter the behavior of the chat model. Open the AI Agent node. In the bottom of the panel is a section labeled 'Options' and a selector labeled 'Add Option'. Use this to select 'System message' The system message is now displayed. This is the same priming prompt we noticed before in the logs. Change the prompt to something else to prime the chat model in a different way. You could try something like \"You are a brilliant poet who always replies in rhyming couplets\" for example. Close the node and return to the chat window. Repeat your message and notice how the output has changed. 8. Adding persistence# The chat model is now giving us useful output, but there is something wrong with it which will become apparent when you try to have a conversation. Use the chat and tell the chat model your name, for example \"Hi there, my name is Nick\". Wait for the response, then type the message \"What's my name?\". The AI will not be able to tell you, however apologetic it may seem. The reason for this is we are not saving the context. The AI Agent has no memory. In order to remember what has happened in the conversation, the AI Agent needs to preserve context. We can do this by adding memory to the AI Agent node. On the canvas click on the on the bottom of the AI Agent node labeled \"Memory\". From the panel which appears, select \"Simple Memory\". This will use the memory from the instance running n8n, and is usually sufficient for simple usage. The default value of 5 interactions should be sufficient here, but remember where this option is if you may want to change it later. Repeat the exercise of having a conversation above, and see that the AI Agent now remembers your name. 9. Saving the workflow# Before we leave the workflow editor, remember to save the workflow or all your changes will be lost. Click on the \"Save\" button in the top right of the editor window. Your workflow will now be saved and you can return to it later to chat again or add new features. Congratulations!# You have taken your first steps in building useful and effective workflows with AI. In this tutorial we have investigated the basic building blocks of an AI workflow, added an AI Agent and a chat model, and adjusted the prompt to get the kind of output we wanted. We also added memory so the chat could retain context between messages.

    "content": "n8n Form node# Use the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple steps. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. You must start the workflow with the n8n Form Trigger. View workflow file Setting up the node# Set default selections with query parameters# You can set the initial values for fields by using query parameters with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL. Only for production Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode. When using query parameters, percent-encode any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like URL Encode/Decode to format your query parameters using percent-encoding. As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties: Production URL: https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form Fields: name: Jane Doe email: jane.doe@example.com With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above: 1 https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (@) with the string %40 and the space character () with the string %20. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on. Displaying custom HTML# You can display custom HTML on your form by adding a Custom HTML field to your form. This provides an HTML box where you can insert arbitrary HTML code to display as part of the form page. You can use the HTML field to enrich your form page by including things like links, images, videos, and more. n8n will render the content with the rest of the form fields in the normal document flow. Because custom HTML content is read-only, these fields aren't included in the form output data by default. To include the raw HTML content in the node output, provide a name for the data using the Element Name field. The HTML field doesn't support <script>, <style>, or <input> elements. Including hidden fields# It's possible to include fields in a form without displaying them to users. This is useful when you want to pass extra data to the form that doesn't require interactive user input. To add fields that won't show up on the form, use the Hidden Field form element. There, you can define the Field Name and optionally provide a default value by filling out the Field Value. When serving the form, you can pass values for hidden fields using query parameters. Defining the form using JSON# Use Define Form > Using JSON to define the fields of your form with a JSON array of objects. Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys: fieldLabel: The label that appears above the input field. fieldType: Choose from date, dropdown, email, file, number, password, text, or textarea. Use date to include a date picker in the form. Refer to Date and time with Luxon for more information on formatting dates. When using dropdown, set the choices with fieldOptions (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set multiselect to true. When using file, set multipleFiles to true to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set acceptFileTypes to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below). placeholder: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every fieldType except dropdown, date, and file. requiredField: Require users to complete this field on the form. An example JSON that shows the general format required and the keys available: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 // Use the \"requiredField\" key on any field to mark it as mandatory // Use the \"placeholder\" key to specify placeholder data for all fields // except 'dropdown', 'date' and 'file' [ { \"fieldLabel\": \"Date Field\", \"fieldType\": \"date\", \"formatDate\": \"mm/dd/yyyy\", // how to format received date in n8n \"requiredField\": true }, { \"fieldLabel\": \"Dropdown Options\", \"fieldType\": \"dropdown\", \"fieldOptions\": { \"values\": [ { \"option\": \"option 1\" }, { \"option\": \"option 2\" } ] }, \"requiredField\": true }, { \"fieldLabel\": \"Multiselect\", \"fieldType\": \"dropdown\", \"fieldOptions\": { \"values\": [ { \"option\": \"option 1\" }, { \"option\": \"option 2\" } ] }, \"multiselect\": true // setting to true allows multi-select }, { \"fieldLabel\": \"Email\", \"fieldType\": \"email\", \"placeholder\": \"me@mail.con\" }, { \"fieldLabel\": \"File\", \"fieldType\": \"file\", \"multipleFiles\": true, // setting to true allows multiple files selection \"acceptFileTypes\": \".jpg, .png\" // allowed file types }, { \"fieldLabel\": \"Number\", \"fieldType\": \"number\" }, { \"fieldLabel\": \"Password\", \"fieldType\": \"password\" }, { // \"fieldType\": \"text\" can be omitted since it's the default type \"fieldLabel\": \"Text\" }, { \"fieldLabel\": \"Textarea\", \"fieldType\": \"textarea\" } ] Form Ending# Use the Form Ending Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page, redirect the user to a URL, or display custom HTML or text. Only one Form Ending page displays per execution, even when n8n executes multiple branches that contain Form Ending nodes. Choose between these options when using On n8n Form Submission: Show Completion Screen: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form. Fill in Completion Title to set the h1 title on the form. n8n displays the Completion Message as a subtitle below the main h1 title on the form. Use \\n or <br> to add a line break. Select Add option and fill in Completion Page Title to set the page's title in the browser tab. When using Redirect to URL, fill in the URL field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form. Use Show Text to display a final page defined by arbitrary plain text and HTML. Fill in the Text field with the HTML or plain text content you wish to show. Forms with branches# The n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs. Workflows with mutually exclusive branches# Form workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the Form Ending page type. This workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch. View workflow file Workflows that may execute multiple branches# Form workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a switch node), n8n executes each branch that receives data sequentially. Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data. n8n only executes a single Form Ending n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch. This workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which Form Ending node displays): View workflow file Node options# Select Add Option to view more configuration options: Form Title: The title for your form. n8n displays the Form Title as the webpage title and main h1 title on the form. Form Description: The description for your form. n8n displays the Form Description as a subtitle below the main h1 title on the form. This field supports HTML. Use \\n or <br> to add a line break. The Form Description also populates the HTML meta description for the page. Button Label: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the Button Label as the name of the submit button. Running the node# Build and test workflows# While building or testing a workflow, use the Test URL in the n8n Form Trigger. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. There are two ways to test: Select Test Step. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow. Select Test Workflow. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow. Production workflows# When your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's Production URL by opening the trigger node and selecting the Production URL in the From URLS selector. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form. When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

The release of n8n 1.0 marks a milestone in n8n's journey to make n8n available for demanding production environments. Version 1.0 represents the hard work invested over the last four years to make n8n the most accessible, powerful, and versatile automation tool. n8n 1.0 is now ready for use in production. New features# Python support in the Code node# Although JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the Code node and even make use of many Python modules. Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0. PR #4295, PR #6209 Execution order# n8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows: In multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first. n8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute. Your existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in workflow settings. PR #4238, PR #6246, PR #6507 Deprecations# MySQL and MariaDB# n8n has removed support for MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends for n8n. These database systems are used by only a few users, yet they require continuous development and maintenance efforts. n8n recommends migrating to PostgreSQL for better compatibility and long-term support. PR #6189 EXECUTIONS_PROCESS and \"own\" mode# Previously, you could use the EXECUTIONS_PROCESS environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the main process or in their own processes. This option and own mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0, main will be the new default. Note that executions start much faster in main mode than in own mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure queue mode to distribute executions among multiple workers. PR #6196 Breaking changes# Docker# Permissions change# When using Docker-based deployments, the n8n process is now run by the user node instead of root. This change increases security. If permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host: 1 docker run --rm -it --user root -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n --entrypoint chown n8nio/base:16 -R node:node /home/node/.n8n Image removal# We've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images. Entrypoint change# The entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running n8n worker --concurrency=5 it's now worker --concurrency=5 PR #6365 Workflow failures due to expression errors# Workflow executions may fail due to syntax or runtime errors in expressions, such as those that reference non-existent nodes. While expressions already throw errors on the frontend, this change ensures that n8n also throws errors on the backend, where they were previously silently ignored. To receive notifications of failing workflows, n8n recommends setting up an \"error workflow\" under workflow settings. PR #6352 Mandatory owner account# This change makes User Management mandatory and removes support for other authentication methods, such as BasicAuth and External JWT. Note that the number of permitted users on n8n.cloud or custom plans still varies depending on your subscription. PR #6362 Directory for installing custom nodes# n8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global node_modules directory. Instead, you must install (or link) them to ~/.n8n/custom (or a directory defined by N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in ~/.n8n/nodes. If you have custom nodes that were linked using npm link into the global node_modules directory, you need to link them again, into ~/.n8n/nodes instead. PR #6396 WebSockets# The N8N_PUSH_BACKEND environment variable can be used to configure one of two available methods for pushing updates to the user interface: sse and websocket. Starting with n8n 1.0, websocket is the default method. PR #6196 Date transformation functions# n8n provides various transformation functions that operate on dates. These functions may return either a JavaScript Date or a Luxon DateTime object. With the new behavior, the return type always matches the input. If you call a date transformation function on a Date, it returns a Date. Similarly, if you call it on a DateTime object, it returns a DateTime object. To identify any workflows and nodes that might be impacted by this change, you can use this utility workflow. For more information about date transformation functions, please refer to the official documentation. PR #6435 Execution data retention# Starting from n8n 1.0, all successful, failed, and manual workflow executions will be saved by default. These settings can be modified for each workflow under \"Workflow Settings,\" or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE setting will be enabled by default, with EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity. PR #6577 Removed N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB# The legacy request library has been deprecated for some time now. As of n8n 1.0, the ability to fall back to it in the HTTP Request node by setting the N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB environment variable has been fully removed. The HTTP Request node will now always use the new HttpRequest interface. If you build custom nodes, refer to HTTP request helpers for more information on migrating to the new interface. PR #6413 Removed WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL# As of version 0.227.0, n8n has renamed the WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL configuration option to WEBHOOK_URL. In n8n 1.0, WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL has been removed. Update your setup to reflect the new name. For more information about this configuration option, refer to the docs. PR #1408 Remove Node 16 support# n8n now requires Node 18.17.0 or above. Updating to n8n 1.0# Create a full backup of n8n. n8n recommends updating to the latest n8n 0.x release before updating to n8n 1.x. This will allow you to pinpoint any potential issues to the correct release. Once you have verified that n8n 0.x starts up without any issues, proceed to the next step. Carefully read the Deprecations and Breaking Changes sections above to assess how they may affect your setup.

If you encounter any issues, redeploy the previous n8n version and restore the backup. Reporting issues# If you encounter any issues during the process of updating to n8n 1.0, please seek help in the community forum. Thank you# We would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of our users for their continued support and feedback. Your contributions are invaluable in helping us make n8n the best possible automation tool. We're excited to continue working with you as we move forward with the release of version 1.0 and beyond.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Ollama Chat Model node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node parameters# Model: Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from: Llama2 Llama2 13B Llama2 70B Llama2 Uncensored Refer to the Ollama Models Library documentation for more information about available models.

Using the structured output parser to format intermediary steps# The Structured Output Parser node structures the final output from AI agents. It's not intended to structure intermediary output to pass to other AI tools or stages. To request a specific format for intermediary output, include the response structure in the System Message for the AI Agent. The message can include either a schema or example response for the agent to use as a template for its results. Structuring output from agents# Structured output parsing is often not reliable when working with agents. If your workflow uses agents, n8n recommends using a separate LLM-chain to receive the data from the agent and parse it.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including: Setting up and configuring servers and containers Managing application resources and scaling Securing servers and applications Configuring n8n n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud. Latest and Next versions n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum. Current latest: 1.86.1 Current next: 1.88.0 Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project# The quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the Deploy to Heroku button: This opens the Create New App page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to. Configure environment variables# Heroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the env section of the app.json file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses. You can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values: N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY, which n8n uses to encrypt user account details before saving to the database. WEBHOOK_URL should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL. Deploy n8n# Select Deploy app. After Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to Manage App or View the application. Heroku and DNS Refer to the Heroku documentation to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application. Changing the deployment template# You can make changes to the deployment template by forking the repository and deploying from you fork. The Dockerfile# By default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the Dockerfile. Heroku and exposing ports# Heroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the EXPOSE command. Instead, Heroku provides a PORT environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The entrypoint.sh file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser. Docker limitations with Heroku Read this guide for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku. Configuring Heroku# The heroku.yml file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections: setup > addons defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon. The build section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a web service based on the supplied Dockerfile. Next steps# Learn more about configuring and scaling n8n.

Droplet resources When creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough. SSH key or Password DigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure. Log in to your Droplet and create new user# The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to How to Connect to Droplets with SSH for more information. You should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user: Log in as root. Create a new user: 1 adduser <username> Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user. Grant the new user administrative privileges: 1 usermod -aG sudo <username> You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using sudo before the command. Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: Add Public Key Authentication. Log out of the droplet. Log in using SSH as the new user. Clone configuration repository# Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from this repository into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make. Clone the repository with the following command: 1 git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned: 1 cd n8n-docker-caddy Default folders and files# The host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are: caddy_config: Holds the Caddy configuration files. local_files: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n. Create Docker volumes# To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create a Docker volume that Docker reuses between restarts: 1 sudo docker volume create caddy_data Create a Docker volume for the n8n data: 1 sudo docker volume create n8n_data Set up DNS# n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new \"A\" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts. Open ports# n8n runs as a web application, so the Droplet needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic. Open the following ports in the Droplet's firewall by running the following two commands: 1 2 sudo ufw allow 80 sudo ufw allow 443 Configure n8n# n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example .env file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own. Open the file with the following command: 1 nano .env The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details. The Docker Compose file# The Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n. The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers. The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the .env file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers. The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the .env file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command: 1 nano docker-compose.yml Configure Caddy# Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the Caddyfile file in the caddy_config folder. 1 nano caddy_config/Caddyfile Change the placeholder domain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to n8n.example.com. The n8n in the reverse_proxy setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the docker-compose.yml file: 1 2 3 4 5 n8n.<domain>.<suffix> { reverse_proxy n8n:5678 { flush_interval -1 } } If you were to use automate.example.com, your Caddyfile may look something like: 1 2 3 4 5 automate.example.com { reverse_proxy n8n:5678 { flush_interval -1 } } Start Docker Compose# Start n8n and Caddy with the following command: 1 sudo docker compose up -d This may take a few minutes. Test your setup# In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

After completing this section, your workflow will look like this: View workflow file First, let's set the scene for building Nathan's workflow. Create new workflow# Open your Editor UI and create a new workflow with one of the two possible commands: Select Ctrl+Alt+N or Cmd+Option+N on your keyboard. Open the left menu, navigate to Workflows, and select Add workflow. Name this new workflow \"Nathan's workflow.\" The first thing you need to do is get data from ABCorp's old data warehouse. In a previous chapter, you used an action node designed for a specific service (Hacker News). But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company. Though we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the HTTP Request node in n8n. No node for that service? The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n. Add an HTTP Request node# Now, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson Adding nodes. The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters. HTTP Request node This node will use credentials. Credentials Credentials are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and allow them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service. In this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, sign up here. In the Parameters of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments: Method: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET. URL: Add the Dataset URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course. Send Headers: Toggle this control to true. In Specify Headers, ensure Using Fields Below is selected. Header Parameters > Name: Enter unique_id. Header Parameters > Value: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course. Authentication: Select Generic Credential Type.

This will open the Credentials window. In the Credentials window, set Name to be the Header Auth name you received in the email when you signed up for this course. In the Credentials window, set Value to be the Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course. Select the Save button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your Credentials Connection window should look like this: HTTP Request node credentials Credentials naming New credential names follow the \" account\" format by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials. Once you save, exit out of the Credentials window to return to the HTTP Request node. Get the data# Select the Test step button in the HTTP Request node window. The table view of the HTTP request results should look like this: HTTP Request node output This view should be familiar to you from the Building a mini-workflow page.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Azure OpenAI Chat Model node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node parameters# Model: Select the model to use to generate the completion. Node options# Frequency Penalty: Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself. Maximum Number of Tokens: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length. Response Format: Choose Text or JSON. JSON ensures the model returns valid JSON. Presence Penalty: Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics. Sampling Temperature: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations. Timeout: Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds. Max Retries: Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request. Top P: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

Depending on how you choose to install n8n, there are differences in how to run the commands: npm: the n8n command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below. Docker: the n8n command is available within your Docker container: 1 docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command> Start a workflow# You can start workflows directly using the CLI. Execute a saved workflow by its ID: 1 n8n execute --id <ID> Change the active status of a workflow# You can change the active status of a workflow using the CLI.

Command flags: Flag Description --help Help prompt. --all Exports all workflows/credentials. --backup Sets --all --pretty --separate for backups. You can optionally set --output. --id The ID of the workflow to export. --output Outputs file name or directory if using separate files. --pretty Formats the output in an easier to read fashion. --separate Exports one file per workflow (useful for versioning).

Update the IDs When exporting workflows and credentials, n8n also exports their IDs. If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.

Migrating to SQLite n8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits. This might result in errors like Data too long for column name during the import process.

    "h1": "Design your node's user interface#",
    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/",
    "content": "Design your node's user interface# Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience. This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes. Design guidance# All node's use n8n's node UI elements, so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process: Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself: What can you leave out? What can you simplify? Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them? Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on showing and hiding fields. Standards# UI text style# Element Style Drop-down value Title case Hint Sentence case Info box Sentence case. Don't use a period (.) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. Node name Title case Parameter name Title case Subtitle Title case Tooltip Sentence case. Don't use a period (.) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. UI text terminology# Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on name and description for upsert operations). Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint. Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives. Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of directory or folder then stick to it. Node naming conventions# Convention Correct Incorrect If a node is a trigger node, the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end, with a space before. Shopify Trigger ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger Don't include 'node' in the name. Asana Asana Node, Asana node Showing and hiding fields# Fields can either be: Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields. Hidden in the Optional fields section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields. Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a Filter by date toggle, and a Date to filter by datepicker, don't display Date to filter by until the user enables Filter by date. Conventions by field type# Credentials# n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node. Resources and operations# APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, \"get all tasks.\" In this example, \"task\" is the resource, and \"get all\" is the operation. When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be Resource, and your second field should be Operation. Required fields# Order fields by: Most important to least important. Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for Document, Page, and Text to insert, put them in that order. Optional fields# Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename Email and Secondary Email to Email (primary) and Email (secondary). If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, Defaults to false. Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected. If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme. Help# There are five types of help built in to the GUI: Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to UI elements | Notice for more information. Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention. Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive. Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to UI elements | Hints for more information. Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon . Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need. You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information. When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it. Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field. Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information. Errors# Make it clear which fields are required. Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email. When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in Details. Toggles# Tooltips for binary states should start with something like Whether to . . . . You may need a list rather than a toggle: Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, Simplify Output?. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear. Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, Append?. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded). Lists# Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option. Sort list options alphabetically. You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information. If there is an option like All, use the word All, not shorthand like *. Trigger node inputs# When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on: Name the parameter Trigger on. Don't include a tooltip. Subtitles# Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example: 1 subtitle: '={{$parameter[\"operation\"] + \": \" + $parameter[\"resource\"]}}', IDs# When performing an operation on a specific record, such as \"update a task comment\" you need a way to specify which record you want to change. Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record: By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the loadOptions parameter. Refer to Base files for more information. By entering an ID. Name the field <Record name> name or ID. For example, Workspace Name or ID. Add a tooltip saying \"Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression.\" Link to n8n's Expressions documentation. Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example: If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path. If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL. Dates and timestamps# n8n uses ISO timestamp strings for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats. JSON# You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON: Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object. Using an expression that returns JSON. Node icons# Common patterns and exceptions# This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards. Simplify responses# APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data: Name: Simplify Response Description: Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data Upsert operations# This should always be a separate operation with: Name: Create or Update Description: Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert) Boolean operators# n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs. For example, you have a field called Must match to test if values match. Include options to test for Any and All, as separate options. Source keys or binary properties# Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms \"binary data\" or \"binary property\" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: Input data field name / Output data field name."

    "content": "Hosting n8n on Amazon Web Services# This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy. Hosting options# AWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes). This guide uses EKS as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes. Prerequisites# The steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and the eksctl CLI tool for EKS. While not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to install the AWS CLI tool, and configure authentication of the tool. Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including: Setting up and configuring servers and containers Managing application resources and scaling Securing servers and applications Configuring n8n n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud. Latest and Next versions n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum. Current latest: 1.86.1 Current next: 1.88.0 Create a cluster# Use the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command: 1 eksctl create cluster --name n8n --region <your-aws-region> This can take a while to create the cluster. Once the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster. Clone configuration repository# Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from this repository. The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change. Clone the repository with the following command: 1 git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b aws And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned: 1 cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting Configure Postgres# For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite. Configure volume for persistent storage# To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, gp2, is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the postgres-claaim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest. 1 2 3 4 5 6 … spec: storageClassName: gp2 accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce … Postgres environment variables# Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers. The example postgres-secret.yaml file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use. The postgres-deployment.yaml manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods. Configure n8n# Create a volume for file storage# While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist manual n8n encryption keys between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup. The n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the volumes section of the n8n-deployment.yaml manifest. 1 2 3 4 5 6 … volumes: - name: n8n-claim0 persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: n8n-claim0 … Pod resources# Kubernetes lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the resources section of the n8n-deployment.yaml file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 … resources: requests: memory: \"250Mi\" limits: memory: \"500Mi\" … This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings: Start: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable Pro (10k executions): 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable Pro (50k executions): 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable Optional: Environment variables# You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables. Create an n8n-secret.yaml file. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details. Deployments# The two deployment manifests (n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes. The manifests define the following: Send the environment variables defined to each application pod Define the container image to use Set resource consumption limits The volumes defined earlier and volumeMounts to define the path in the container to mount volumes. Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs. Services# The two service manifests (postgres-service.yaml and n8n-service.yaml) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default. Send to Kubernetes cluster# Send all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the n8n-kubernetes-hosting directory: 1 kubectl apply -f . Namespace error You may see an error message about not finding an \"n8n\" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command: 1 kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml Set up DNS# n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance. To find the address of the n8n service running on the instance: Open the Clusters section of the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service page in the AWS console. Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page. Select the Resources tab, then Service and networking > Services. Select the n8n service and copy the Load balancer URLs value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS. Use HTTP This guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in n8n-deployment.yaml. However, if you click the Load balancer URLs value, EKS takes you to an \"HTTPS\" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP. Delete resources# If you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command: 1 kubectl delete -f .

For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to Embed on the n8n website. The requirements provided here are an example based on n8n Cloud and are for illustrative purposes only. Your requirements may vary depending on the number of users, workflows, and executions. Contact n8n for more information. Component Sizing Supported CPU/vCPU Minimum 10 CPU cycles, scaling as needed Any public or private cloud Database 512 MB - 4 GB SSD SQLite or PostgreSQL Memory 320 MB - 2 GB CPU considerations# n8n isn't CPU intensive so even small instances (of providers such as AWS and GCP) should be enough for most use cases. Usually, memory requirements supersede CPU requirements, so focus resources there when planning your infrastructure. Database considerations# n8n uses its database to store credentials, past executions, and workflows. A core feature of n8n is the flexibility to choose a database. All the supported databases have different advantages and disadvantages, which you have to consider individually and pick the one that best suits your needs. By default n8n creates an SQLite database if no database exists at the given location. n8n recommends that every n8n instance have a dedicated database. This helps to prevent dependencies and potential performance degradation. If it isn't possible to provide a dedicated database for every n8n instance, n8n recommends making use of Postgres's schema feature. For Postgres, the database must already exist on the DB-instance. The database user for the n8n process needs to have full permissions on all tables that they're using or creating. n8n creates and maintains the database schema. Best practices# SSD storage. In containerized cloud environments, ensure that the volume is persisted and mounted when stopping/starting a container. If not, all data is lost. If using Postgres, don't use the tablePrefix configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future. Pay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading. Set up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups. Memory considerations# An n8n instance doesn't typically require large amounts of available memory. For example an n8n Cloud instance at idle requires ~100MB. It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements. For example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the Code node creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources."

Be aware of how n8n decides which node version to load: If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node. When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node. Versioning type restricted by node style If you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning. Light versioning# This is available for all node types. One node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature: Change the main version parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with @version in your displayOptions in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;. As an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the Declarative node tutorial, then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base NasaPics.node.ts file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 { displayName: 'NASA Pics', name: 'NasaPics', icon: 'file:nasapics.svg', // List the available versions version: [1,2,3], // More basic parameters here properties: [ // Add a resource that's only displayed for version2 { displayName: 'Resource name', // More resource parameters displayOptions: { show: { '@version': 2, }, }, }, ], } Full versioning# This isn't available for declarative-style nodes. As an example, refer to the Mattermost node. Full versioning summary: The base node file should extend NodeVersionedType instead of INodeType. The base node file should contain a description including the defaultVersion (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality. n8n recommends using v1, v2, and so on, for version folder names."

    "content": "Merging and splitting data# In this chapter, you will learn how to merge and split data, and in what cases it might be useful to perform these operations. Merging data# In some cases, you might need to merge (combine) and process data from different sources. Merging data can involve: Creating one data set from multiple sources. Synchronizing data between multiple systems. This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another. One-way vs. two-way sync In a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system. In a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well. This blog tutorial explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs. In n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the Merge node, which provides several merging options: Append Combine Merge by Fields: requires input fields to match on Merge by Position Combine all possible combinations Choose Branch Notice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the Merge node, they're called Input 1 Field and Input 2 Field. Property Input fields in the Merge node Property Input in dot notation If you want to reference nested values in the Merge node parameters Input 1 Field and Input 2 Field, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression). Note You can also find the Merge node under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins. Merge Exercise# Build a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node. Add a Merge node that takes Input 1 from a Customer Datastore node and Input 2 from a Code node. In the Customer Datastore node, run the operation Get All People. In the Code node, create an array of two objects with three properties: name, language, and country, where the property country has two sub-properties code and name. Fill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database. For example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States. In the Merge node, try out different merge options. Show me the solution Looping# In some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops). n8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows. However, there are some exceptions of nodes and operations that will require you to build a loop into your workflow. To create a loop in an n8n workflow, you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an If node to check when to stop the loop. Splitting data in batches# If you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the Code node multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches. For these processes, use the Loop Over Items node. This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data. Execution of Loop Over Items node The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an If node to stop the loop. Loop/Batch Exercise# Build a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes: A Code node that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io) and dev.to (https://dev.to/feed/n8n). A Loop Over Items node with Batch Size: 1, that takes in the inputs from the Code node and RSS Read node and iterates over the items. An RSS Read node that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: {{ $json.url }}. The RSS Read node is one of the exception nodes which processes only the first item it receives, so the Loop Over Items node is necessary for iterating over multiple items. Show me the solution"

To debug, check that the following: That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the cron examples That your cron expression (after removing the seconds column) validates on crontab guru Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time# If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses. Adjust the timezone globally# If you're using n8n Cloud, follow the instructions on the set the Cloud instance timezone page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time. If you're self hosting, set your global timezone using the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable. Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow# To set the timezone for an individual workflow: Open the workflow on the canvas. Select the Three dots icon in the upper-right corner. Select Settings. Change the Timezone setting. Select Save. Variables not working as expected# While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. After activating the worfklow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then re-activate the workflow to apply the updated variable value. Changing the trigger interval# You can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is activated. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then re-activate the workflow. Also, the schedule begins from the time when you activate the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and re-activated the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you activated it."

Development# During development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below. Implementation details# n8n uses the LoggerProxy class, located in the workflow package. Calling the LoggerProxy.init() by passing in an instance of Logger, initializes the class before the usage. The initialization process happens only once. The start.ts file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the LoggerProxy class. Once the Logger implementation gets created in the cli package, it can be obtained by calling the getInstance convenience method from the exported module. Check the start.ts file to learn more about how this process works. Adding logs# Once the LoggerProxy class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs. Convenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta), where meta represents any additional properties desired beyond message. In the example above, we use the standard log levels described above. The message argument is a string, and meta is a data object. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier import { LoggerProxy as Logger } from 'n8n-workflow'; // Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties Logger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow \"${workflow.name}\"`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id}); When creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are: Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes. Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering. Include multiple IDs (for example, executionId, workflowId, and sessionId) throughout all logs. Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search. Front-end logs# As of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using Logger or LoggerProxy would yield errors in the editor-ui package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions."

Processing parameters# The Ollama Chat Model node is a sub-node. Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance# The Ollama Chat Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance. To use the Ollama Chat Model, follow the Ollama credentials instructions to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n. Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker# The Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by Ollama credentials. When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama. Ollama typically listens for connections on localhost, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own localhost which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over localhost. The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components. If only Ollama is in Docker# If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). When running the container, publish the ports with the -p flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this: 1 docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama When configuring Ollama credentials, the localhost address should work without a problem (set the base URL to http://localhost:11434). If only n8n is in Docker# If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 on the host. If you are running n8n in Docker on Linux, use the --add-host flag to map host.docker.internal to host-gateway when you start the container. For example: 1 docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you. When configuring Ollama credentials, use host.docker.internal as the host address instead of localhost. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to http://host.docker.internal:11434. If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers# If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them. Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). When configuring Ollama credentials, use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of localhost. For example, if you call the Ollama container my-ollama and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to http://my-ollama:11434. If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container# If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the localhost address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the Ollama credentials in n8n to use localhost: http://localhost:11434. Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434# This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address. To fix this, change the base URL in your Ollama credentials to connect to 127.0.0.1, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the localhost alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: http://127.0.0.1:11434."

    "content": "What are vector databases?# Vector databases store information as numbers: A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. (source) This enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning. A simplified example# A vector database could store the sentence \"n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host\", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence. Suppose that in a vector store 0.1 represents automation tool, 0.2 represents source available, and 0.3 represents can be self-hosted. You could end up with the following vectors: Sentence Vector (array of dimensions) n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] Zapier is an automation tool [0.1] Make is an automation tool [0.1] Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host [0.3] This example is very simplified In practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding. Demonstrating the power of similarity search# Qdrant provides vector search demos to help users understand the power of vector databases. The food discovery demo shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities. This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. (source) For full technical details, refer to the Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository. Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders# Vector databases require other tools to function: Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for embedding. Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks. Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings. Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data."

Refer to GoogleDrive.node.ts for an example where users can browse the list or search. Resource mapper# If your node performs insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type. Mapping and matching Mapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 { displayName: 'Columns', name: 'columns', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code type: 'resourceMapper', // The UI element type default: { // mappingMode can be defined in the component (mappingMode: 'defineBelow') // or you can attempt automatic mapping (mappingMode: 'autoMapInputData') mappingMode: 'defineBelow', // Important: always set default value to null value: null, }, required: true, // See \"Resource mapper type options interface\" below for the full typeOptions specification typeOptions: { resourceMapper: { resourceMapperMethod: 'getMappingColumns', mode: 'update', fieldWords: { singular: 'column', plural: 'columns', }, addAllFields: true, multiKeyMatch: true, supportAutoMap: true, matchingFieldsLabels: { title: 'Custom matching columns title', description: 'Help text for custom matching columns', hint: 'Below-field hint for custom matching columns', }, }, }, }, Refer to the Postgres node (version 2) for a live example using a database schema. Refer to the Google Sheets node (version 2) for a live example using a schema-less service. Resource mapper type options interface# The typeOptions section must implement the following interface: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 export interface ResourceMapperTypeOptions { // The name of the method where you fetch the schema // Refer to the Resource mapper method section for more detail resourceMapperMethod: string; // Choose the mode for your operation // Supported modes: add, update, upsert mode: 'add' | 'update' | 'upsert'; // Specify labels for fields in the UI fieldWords?: { singular: string; plural: string }; // Whether n8n should display a UI input for every field when node first added to workflow // Default is true addAllFields?: boolean; // Specify a message to show if no fields are fetched from the service // (the call is successful but the response is empty) noFieldsError?: string; // Whether to support multi-key column matching // multiKeyMatch is for update and upsert only // Default is false // If true, the node displays a multi-select dropdown for the matching column selector multiKeyMatch?: boolean; // Whether to support automatic mapping // If false, n8n hides the mapping mode selector field and sets mappingMode to defineBelow supportAutoMap?: boolean; // Custom labels for the matching columns selector matchingFieldsLabels?: { title?: string; description?: string; hint?: string; }; } Resource mapper method# This method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema. Every node must implement its own logic for fetching the schema, and setting up each UI field according to the schema. It must return a value that implements the ResourceMapperFields interface: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 interface ResourceMapperField { // Field ID as in the service id: string; // Field label displayName: string; // Whether n8n should pre-select the field as a matching field // A matching field is a column used to identify the rows to modify defaultMatch: boolean; // Whether the field can be used as a matching field canBeUsedToMatch?: boolean; // Whether the field is required by the schema required: boolean; // Whether to display the field in the UI // If false, can't be used for matching or mapping display: boolean; // The data type for the field // These correspond to UI element types // Supported types: string, number, dateTime, boolean, time, array, object, options type?: FieldType; // Added at runtime if the field is removed from mapping by the user removed?: boolean; // Specify options for enumerated types options?: INodePropertyOptions[]; } Refer to the Postgres resource mapping method and Google Sheets resource mapping method for live examples.

    "content": "AI coding with GPT# Not available on self-hosted. Python isn't supported. /// Use AI in the Code node# Feature availability AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n. AI generated code overwrites your code If you've already written some code on the Code tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed. To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node: In the Code node, set Language to JavaScript. Select the Ask AI tab. Write your query. Select Generate Code. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the Code tab. Usage limits# During the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier. Feature limits# The ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations: The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources. The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null. Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query. Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas. May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node. Writing good prompts# Writing good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back. Some general tips: Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you’re aiming for. Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: \"First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name.\" Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying \"Get the older users,\" you might say \"Filter users who are 60 years and above.\" Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible. And some n8n-specific guidance: Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables. Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. \"Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property\". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: \"Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node.\" Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to Data structure for more information on the data structure n8n requires. Example prompts# These examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks. Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset# To try the example yourself, download the example workflow and import it into n8n. In the third Code node, enter this prompt: The slack data contains only one item. The input data represents all Notion users. Sometimes the person property that holds the email can be null. I want to find the notionId of the Slack user and return it. Take a look at the code the AI generates. This is the JavaScript you need: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 const slackUser = $(\"Mock Slack\").all()[0]; const notionUsers = $input.all(); const slackUserEmail = slackUser.json.email; const notionUser = notionUsers.find( (user) => user.json.person && user.json.person.email === slackUserEmail ); return notionUser ?

In the Join items Code node, enter this prompt: Return a single line of text that has all usernames listed with a comma. Each username should be enquoted with a double quotation mark.

With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure. Investigating errors To investigate failed executions, you can: Review your Executions, for a single workflow or all workflows you have access to. You can load data from previous execution into your current workflow. Enable Log streaming. Create and set an error workflow# For each workflow, you can set an error workflow in Workflow Settings. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the Error Trigger. You can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node. Give the workflow a name, for example Error Handler. Select Save. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow: Select Options > Settings. In Error workflow, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select Error handler. Select Save. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs. Error data# The default error data received by the Error Trigger is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 [ { \"execution\": { \"id\": \"231\", \"url\": \"https://n8n.example.com/execution/231\", \"retryOf\": \"34\", \"error\": { \"message\": \"Example Error Message\", \"stack\": \"Stacktrace\" }, \"lastNodeExecuted\": \"Node With Error\", \"mode\": \"manual\" }, \"workflow\": { \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Example Workflow\" } } ] All information is always present, except: execution.id: requires the execution to be saved in the database.

Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute. execution.retryOf: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution. If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different.

    "content": "3. Filtering Orders# In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and how to use expressions in nodes using the If node. After this step, your workflow should look like this: View workflow file To insert only processing orders into Airtable we need to filter our data by orderStatus. Basically, we want to tell the program that if the orderStatus is processing, then insert all records with this status into Airtable; else, for example, if the orderStatus isn't processing, calculate the sum of all orders with the other orderStatus (booked). This if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, you can add conditional logic with the If node, which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. If vs. Switch If you need to filter data on more than boolean values (true and false), use the Switch node. The Switch node is similar to the If node, but supports multiple output connectors. Remove the connection to the Airtable node# First, let's remove the connection between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node: Hover over the arrow connection the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node. Select the trash icon to remove the connection. Configure the If node# With the connection to the Airtable node removed, add an If node connected to the HTTP Request node: Select the + sign coming off the HTTP Request node. Search for the If node. Select it when it appears in the search. For the If node, we'll use an expression. Expressions An expression is a string of characters and symbols in a programming language that can be evaluated to get a value, often according to its input. In n8n workflows, you can use expressions in a node to refer to another node for input data. In our example, the If node references the data output by the HTTP Request node. In the If node window, configure the parameters: Set the value1 placeholder to {{ $json.orderStatus }} with the following steps: Hover over the value1 field. Select the Expression tab on the right side of the value1 field. Next, open the expression editor by selecting the link icon: Opening the Expression Editor Use the left-side panel to select HTTP Request > orderStatus and drag it into the Expression field in the center of the window. Expression Editor in the If node Once you add the expression, close the Edit Expression dialog. Operation: Select String > is equal to Set the value2 placeholder to processing. Data Type Make sure to select the correct data type (boolean, date & time, number, or string) when you select the Operation. Select Test step to test the If node. Your results should look like this: If node output Note that the orders with a processing order status should show for the True Branch output, while the orders with a booked order status should show in the False Branch output. Close the If node detail view when you're finished. Insert data into Airtable# Next, we want to insert this data into Airtable. Remember what Nathan said at the end of the Inserting data into Airtable lesson? I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table... Since Nathan only needs the processing orders in the table, we'll connect the Airtable node to the If node's true connector. In this case, since the Airtable node is already on our canvas, select the If node true connector and drag it to the Airtable node. It's a good idea at this point to retest the Airtable node. Before you do, open your table in Airtable and delete all existing rows. Then open the Airtable node window in n8n and select Test step. Review your data in Airtable to be sure your workflow only added the correct orders (those with orderStatus of processing). There should be 14 records now instead of 30. At this stage, your workflow should look like this: View workflow file What's next?# Nathan 🙋: This If node is so useful for filtering data! Now I have all the information about processing orders. I actually only need the employeeName and orderID, but I guess I can keep all the other fields just in case. You 👩‍🔧: Actually, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Inserting more data requires more computational power, the data transfer is slower and takes longer, and takes up more storage resources in your table. In this particular case, 14 records with 5 fields might not seem like it'd make a significant difference, but if your business grows to thousands of records and dozens of fields, things add up and even one extra column can affect performance. Nathan 🙋: Oh, that's good to know. Can you select only two fields from the processing orders? You 👩‍🔧: Sure, I'll do that in the next step."

For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item.

    "content": "Schedule Trigger node# Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems. You must activate the workflow If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow. Timezone settings The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either: The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to Workflow settings for more information. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is America/New York for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using Environment variables. Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the Admin dashboard. Node parameters# Add Trigger Rules to determine when the trigger should run. Use the Trigger Interval to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from: Seconds trigger interval Minutes trigger interval Hours trigger interval Days trigger interval Weeks trigger interval Months trigger interval Custom (Cron) interval You can add multiple Trigger Rules to run the node on different schedules. Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each Trigger Interval. Refer to Templates and examples for further examples. Seconds trigger interval# Seconds Between Triggers: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter 30 here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds. Minutes trigger interval# Minutes Between Triggers: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter 5 here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes. Hours trigger interval# Hours Between Triggers: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger. Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59. For example, if you enter 6 Hours Between Triggers and 30 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour. Days trigger interval# Days Between Triggers: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger. Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node. Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59. For example, if you enter 2 Days Between Triggers, 9am for Trigger at Hour, and 15 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every two days at 9:15am. Weeks trigger interval# Weeks Between Triggers: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger. Trigger on Weekdays: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node. Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node. Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59. For example, if you enter 2 Weeks Between Triggers, Monday for Trigger on Weekdays, 3pm for Trigger at Hour, and 30 Trigger at Minute, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM. Months trigger interval# Months Between Triggers: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger. Trigger at Day of Month: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from 1 to 31. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter 30 here, the node won't trigger in February. Trigger at Hour: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node. Trigger at Minute: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from 0 to 59. For example, if you enter 3 Months Between Triggers, 28 Trigger at Day of Month, 9am for Trigger at Hour, and 0 Trigger at Minute, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM. Custom (Cron) interval# Enter a custom cron Expression to set the schedule for the trigger. To generate a Cron expression, you can use crontab guru. Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the Expression field in n8n. Examples# Type Cron Expression Description Every X Seconds */10 * * * * * Every 10 seconds. Every X Minutes */5 * * * * Every 5 minutes. Hourly 0 * * * * Every hour on the hour. Daily 0 6 * * * At 6:00 AM every day. Weekly 0 12 * * 1 At noon every Monday. Monthly 0 0 1 * * At midnight on the 1st of every month. Every X Days 0 0 */3 * * At midnight every 3rd day. Only Weekdays 0 9 * * 1-5 At 9:00 AM Monday through Friday. Custom Hourly Range 0 9-17 * * * Every hour from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. Quarterly 0 0 1 1,4,7,10 * At midnight on the 1st of January, April, July, and October. Using variables in the Cron expression While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. If you alter a variable's value in the settings after a workflow is activated, the changes won't alter the cron schedule. To re-evaluate the variable, set the workflow to Inactive and then back to Active again Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression# The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/",
    "content": "n8n Form Trigger node# Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use. You can add more pages to continue the form with the n8n Form node. Build and test workflows# While building or testing a workflow, use the Test URL. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. There are two ways to test: Select Test Step. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow. Select Test Workflow. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow. Production workflows# When your workflow is ready, switch to using the Production URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form. When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL. Set default selections with query parameters# You can set the initial values for fields by using query parameters with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL. Only for production Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode. When using query parameters, percent-encode any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like URL Encode/Decode to format your query parameters using percent-encoding. As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties: Production URL: https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form Fields: name: Jane Doe email: jane.doe@example.com With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above: 1 https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (@) with the string %40 and the space character () with the string %20. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on. Node parameters# These are the main node configuration fields: Authentication# Basic Auth None Using basic auth# To configure this credential, you'll need: The Username you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting. The Password that goes with that username. Form URLs# The Form Trigger node has two URLs: Test URL and Production URL. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select Test URL or Production URL to toggle which URL n8n displays. Test URL: n8n registers a test webhook when you select Test Step or Test Workflow, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow. Production URL: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the Executions tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view. Form Path# Set a custom slug for the form. Form Title# Enter the title for your form. n8n displays the Form Title as the webpage title and main h1 title on the form. Form Description# Enter the description for your form. n8n displays the Form Description as a subtitle below the main h1 title on the form. Use \\n or <br> to add a line break. Form Elements# Create the question fields for your form. Select Add Form Element to add a new field. Every field has the following settings: Field Label: Enter the label that appears above the input field. Element Type: Choose from Custom HTML, Date, Dropdown List, Email, File, Hidden Field, Number, Password, Text, or Textarea. Select Custom HTML to insert arbitrary HTML. You can include elements like links, images, video, and more. You can't include <script>, <style>, or <input> elements. By default, Custom HTML fields aren't included in the node output. To include the Custom HTML content in the output, fill out the associated Element Name field. Select Date to include a date picker in the form. Refer to Date and time with Luxon for more information on formatting dates. Select Dropdown List > Add Field Option to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on Multiple Choice. Select Hidden Field to include a form element without displaying it on the form. You can set a default value using the Field Value parameter or pass values for the field using query parameters. Required Field: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form. Respond When# Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when: Form Is Submitted: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form. Workflow Finishes: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form. Node options# Select Add Option to view more configuration options: Append n8n Attribution: Turn off to hide the Form automated with n8n attribute at the bottom of the form. Form Response: Choose how to respond when the user submits the form. Respond With > Form Submitted Text: Show a message to the user. Respond With > Redirect URL: Send the user to a new page. Ignore Bots: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers. Use Workflow Timezone: Turn on to use the timezone in the Workflow settings instead of UTC (default).

    "content": "MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node# MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is a feature of MongoDB Atlas that enables users to store and query vector embeddings. Use this node to interact with Vector Search indexes in your MongoDB Atlas collections. You can insert documents, retrieve documents, and use the vector store in chains or as a tool for agents. On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Prerequisites# Before using this node, create a Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Follow these steps to create one: Log in to the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Select your organization and project. Find \"Search & Vector Search\" section. Select your cluster and click \"Go to search\". Click \"Create Search Index\". Choose \"Vector Search\" mode and use the visual or JSON editors. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 { \"fields\": [ { \"type\": \"vector\", \"path\": \"<field-name>\", \"numDimensions\": 1536, // any other value \"similarity\": \"<similarity-function>\" } ] } Adjust the \"dimensions\" value according to your embedding model (For example, 1536 for OpenAI's text-embedding-small-3). Name your index and create. Make sure to note the following values which are required when configuring the node: Collection name Vector index name Field names for embeddings and metadata Node usage patterns# You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node in the following patterns: Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents# You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent. You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of this template (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same). Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool# You can connect the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an AI agent to use the vector store as a resource when answering queries. Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. Use a retriever to fetch documents# You can use the Vector Store Retriever node with the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node to fetch documents from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. This is often used with the Question and Answer Chain node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input. An example of the connection flow (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store. Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions# Another pattern uses the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to summarize results and answer questions from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarize data in the vector store. The connections flow (the linked example uses the In-Memory Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> In-Memory Vector store. Node parameters# Operation Mode# This Vector Store node has four modes: Get Many, Insert Documents, Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool), and Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent). The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available. Get Many# In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context. Insert Documents# Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details. Get Many parameters# Mongo Collection: Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use. Vector Index Name: Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Embedding Field: Enter the field name in your documents that contains the vector embeddings. Metadata Field: Enter the field name in your documents that contains the text metadata. Insert Documents parameters# Mongo Collection: Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use. Vector Index Name: Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Embedding Field: Enter the field name in your documents that contains the vector embeddings. Metadata Field: Enter the field name in your documents that contains the text metadata. Retrieve Documents parameters (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Mongo Collection: Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use. Vector Index Name: Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Embedding Field: Enter the field name in your documents that contains the vector embeddings. Metadata Field: Enter the field name in your documents that contains the text metadata. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters# Name: The name of the vector store. Description: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often. Mongo Collection: Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use. Vector Index Name: Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Node options# Options# Metadata Filter: Filters results based on metadata.

For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance# The Ollama Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance. To use the Ollama Model, follow the Ollama credentials instructions to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n. Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker# The Ollama Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by Ollama credentials. When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama. Ollama typically listens for connections on localhost, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own localhost which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over localhost. The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components. If only Ollama is in Docker# If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). When running the container, publish the ports with the -p flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this: 1 docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama When configuring Ollama credentials, the localhost address should work without a problem (set the base URL to http://localhost:11434). If only n8n is in Docker# If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 on the host. If you are running n8n in Docker on Linux, use the --add-host flag to map host.docker.internal to host-gateway when you start the container. For example: 1 docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you. When configuring Ollama credentials, use host.docker.internal as the host address instead of localhost. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to http://host.docker.internal:11434. If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers# If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them. Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). When configuring Ollama credentials, use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of localhost. For example, if you call the Ollama container my-ollama and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to http://my-ollama:11434. If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container# If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the localhost address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the Ollama credentials in n8n to use localhost: http://localhost:11434. Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434# This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address. To fix this, change the base URL in your Ollama credentials to connect to 127.0.0.1, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the localhost alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: http://127.0.0.1:11434."

    "content": "Dealing with errors in workflows# Sometimes you build a nice workflow, but it fails when you try to execute it. Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors. But don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible. Checking failed workflows# n8n tracks executions of your workflows. When one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows. Open the Executions log by selecting Executions in the left-side panel. To investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the View button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution. Executions log This will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues. To toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the Editor | Executions button at the top of the page. Workflow execution view Catching erroring workflows# To catch failed workflows, create a separate Error Workflow with the Error Trigger node. This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails. Use additional nodes in your Error Workflow that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack. To receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the Error Workflow in the Workflow Settings to an Error Workflow that uses an Error Trigger node. The only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an Error Trigger node. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow. Error workflows If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow. If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow. You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors. You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows. Exercise# In the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it: Create a new Error Workflow. Add the Error Trigger node. Connect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like Slack, Discord, Telegram, or even Gmail or a more generic Send Email. In the workflow you want to monitor, open the Workflow Settings and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow. Show me the solution Throwing exceptions in workflows# Another way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a Stop and Error node in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type: Error Message: returns a custom message about the error Error Object: returns the type of error You can only use the Stop and Error node as the last node in a workflow. When to throw errors Throwing exceptions with the Stop and Error node is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages. If you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as: Wrongly formatted JSON output Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value) Missing values Errors from remote servers Though this kind of invalid data might not cause the workflow to fail right away, it could cause problems later on, and then it can become difficult to track the source error. This is why it's better to throw an error at the time you know there might be a problem. Stop and Error node with error message"

He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an Automation Expert, you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n. Understanding the scenario# You 👩‍🔧: Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first? Nathan 🙋: Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting. I have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers. This manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get it done on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data. You 👩‍🔧: Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data? Nathan 🙋: The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps. You 👩‍🔧: Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!"

Node usage patterns# You can use the Milvus Vector Store node in the following patterns. Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents# You can use the Milvus Vector Store as a regular node to insert, or get documents. This pattern places the Milvus Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent. You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of this template, by replacing the Pinecone Vector store node with the Milvus Vector Store node. Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool# You can connect the Milvus Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an AI agent to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries. Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Milvus Vector Store node. Use a retriever to fetch documents# You can use the Vector Store Retriever node with the Milvus Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Milvus Vector Store node. This is often used with the Question and Answer Chain node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input. An example of the connection flow would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Milvus Vector Store. In this example, the Pinecone Vector Store node should be replaced with the Milvus Vector Store node. Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions# Another pattern uses the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to summarize results and answer questions from the Milvus Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Milvus Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store. The connections flow in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Milvus Vector store. In this example, the Pinecone Vector Store node should be replaced with the Milvus Vector Store node. Node parameters# Operation Mode# This Vector Store node has four modes: Get Many, Insert Documents, Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool), and Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent). The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available. Get Many# In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context. Insert Documents# Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details. Get Many parameters# Milvus Collection: Select or enter the Milvus Collection to use. Prompt: Enter your search query. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Insert Documents parameters# Milvus Collection: Select or enter the Milvus Collection to use. Clear Collection: Specify whether to clear the collection before inserting new documents. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters# Milvus collection: Select or enter the Milvus Collection to use. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters# Name: The name of the vector store. Description: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often. Milvus Collection: Select or enter the Milvus Collection to use. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Node options# Metadata Filter# Available in Get Many mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document. This is an AND query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match. When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to Default Data Loader for more information on loading documents. Clear Collection# Available in Insert Documents mode.

    "h1": "Manual, partial, and production executions#",
    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/manual-partial-and-production-executions/",
    "content": "Manual, partial, and production executions# There are some important differences in how n8n executes workflows manually (by clicking the Test Workflow button) and automatically (when the workflow is Active and triggered by an event or schedule). Manual executions# Manual executions allow you to run workflows directly from the canvas to test your workflow logic. These executions are \"ad-hoc\" — they run only when you manually select the Test workflow button. Manual executions make building workflows easier by allowing you to iteratively test as you go, following the flow logic and seeing data transformations. You can test conditional branching, data formatting changes, and loop behavior by providing different input items and modifying node options. Pinning execution data When performing manual executions, you can use data pinning to \"pin\" or \"freeze\" the output data of a node. You can optionally edit the pinned data as well. On future runs, instead of executing the pinned node, n8n will substitute the pinned data and continue following the flow logic. This allows you to iterate without operating on variable data or repeating queries to external services. Production executions ignore all pinned data. Partial executions# Clicking the Test workflow button at the bottom of the workflow in the Editor tab manually runs the entire workflow. You can also perform partial executions to run specific steps in your workflow. Partial executions are manual executions that only run a subset of your workflow nodes. To perform a partial execution, select a node, open its detail view, and select Test step. This executes the specific node and any preceding nodes required to fill in its input data. You can also temporarily disable specific nodes in the workflow chain to avoid interacting with those services while building. In particular, partial executions are useful when updating the logic of a specific node since they allow you to re-execute the node with the same input data. Troubleshooting partial executions# Some common issues you might come across when running partial executions include the following: The destination node is not connected to any trigger. Partial executions need a trigger. This error message appears when you try to perform a partial execution without connecting the workflow to a trigger. Manual executions, including partial executions, attempt to mimic production executions when possible. Part of this includes requiring a trigger node to describe when the workflow logic should execute. To work around this, connect a trigger node to the workflow with the node you're trying to execute. Most often, a manual trigger is the simplest option. Please execute the whole workflow, rather than just the node. (Existing execution data is too large.) This error can appear when performing partial executions on workflows with large numbers of branches. Partial executions involve sending data and workflow logic to the n8n backend in a way that isn't required for full executions. This error occurs when your workflow exceeds the maximum size allowed for these messages. To work around this, consider using the limit node to limit node output while running partial executions. Once the workflow is running as intended, you can disable or delete the limit node before enabling production execution. Production executions# Production executions occur when a triggering event or schedule automatically runs a workflow. To configure production executions, you must attach a trigger node (any trigger other than the manual trigger works) and switch workflow's toggle to Active. Once activated, the workflow automatically executes whenever the trigger condition occurs. The execution flow for production executions doesn't display in the Editor tab of the workflow as with manual executions. Instead, you can see executions in the workflow's Executions tab according to your workflow settings. From there, you can explore and troubleshoot problems using the debug in editor feature."

Can't produce longer responses# If you need to generate longer responses than the Question and Answer Chain node produces by default, you can try one or more of the following techniques: Connect a more verbose model: Some AI models produce more terse results than others. Swapping your model for one with a larger context window and more verbose output can increase the word length of your responses. Increase the maximum number of tokens: Many model nodes (for example the OpenAI Chat Model) include a Maximum Number of Tokens option. You can set this to increase the maximum number of tokens the model can use to produce a response. Build larger responses in stages: For more detailed answers, you may want to construct replies in stages using a variety of AI nodes. You can use AI split up a single question into multiple prompts and create responses for each. You can then compose a final reply by combining the responses again. Though the details are different, you can find a good example of the general idea in this template for writing a WordPress post with AI."

Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node parameters# Model: Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from: Llama2 Llama2 13B Llama2 70B Llama2 Uncensored Refer to the Ollama Models Library documentation for more information about available models. Node options# Sampling Temperature: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations. Top K: Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token. Top P: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use.

Bad request - please check your parameters# This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because: You're using an invalid name or value in a Query Parameter. You're passing array values in a Query Parameter but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the Array Format in Query Parameters option. Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters. The resource you are requesting could not be found# This error displays when the endpoint URL you entered is invalid. This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint. JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON# This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON. To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues: Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on. If you've used an Expression in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 {{ { \"myjson\": { \"name1\": \"value1\", \"name2\": \"value2\", \"array1\": [\"value1\",\"value2\"] } } }} Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials# This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed. To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to: Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected. Format your generic credential in a different way. Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes. 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you# This error displays when the node receives a 429 error from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the Handling API rate limits page. To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node: Batching# Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them. In the HTTP Request node, select Add Option > Batching. Set Items per Batch to the number of input items to include in each request. Set Batch Interval (ms) to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set Batch Interval (ms) to 1000. Retry on Fail# Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt. In the HTTP Request node, go to Settings and enable Retry on Fail. Set Max Tries to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node. Set Wait Between Tries (ms) to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries.

Enter these parameters: Credential to connect with: Create or select an existing OpenAI credential. Resource: Select Text. Operation: Select Message a Model. Model: Select the model you want to use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try gpt-4o if you need high intelligence or gpt-4o-mini if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to Models overview | OpenAI Platform for more information. Messages: Enter a Text prompt and assign a Role that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to Prompt engineering | OpenAI for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles: User: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model. Assistant: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality. System: By default, the system message is \"You are a helpful assistant\". You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message. Simplify Output: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data. Output Content as JSON: Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than gpt-3.5-turbo-1106. Options# Frequency Penalty: Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between 0.0 and 2.0. Maximum Number of Tokens: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output. Number of Completions: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens. Presence Penalty: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between 0.0 and 2.0. Output Randomness (Temperature): Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between 0.0 (deterministic) and 1.0 (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or Output Randomness (Top P) but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to 1.0. Output Randomness (Top P): Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, 0.5 means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or Output Randomness (Temperature) but not both. Defaults to 1.0. Refer to Message a Model | OpenAI documentation for more information. Classify Text for Violations# Use this operation to identify and flag content that might be harmful. OpenAI model will analyze the text and return a response containing: flagged: A boolean field indicating if the content is potentially harmful. categories: A list of category-specific violation flags. category_scores: Scores for each category. Enter these parameters: Credential to connect with: Create or select an existing OpenAI credential. Resource: Select Text. Operation: Select Classify Text for Violations. Text Input: Enter text to classify if it violates the moderation policy. Simplify Output: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.

Insufficient quota# Quota issues There are a number of OpenAI issues surrounding quotas, including failures when quotas have been recently topped up. To avoid these issues, ensure that there is credit in the account and issue a new API key from the API keys screen. This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit. To troubleshoot this error, on your OpenAI settings page: Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner. Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Check the organization-level billing overview page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page. Check the organization-level usage limits page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the Usage limits section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits. Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select Project > Limits to view or change the project limits. Check that the OpenAI API is operating as expected. Balance waiting period After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance. In n8n: check that the OpenAI credentials use a valid OpenAI API key for the account you've added money to ensure that you connect the OpenAI node to the correct OpenAI credentials If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your OpenAI billing settings to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0. Bad request - please check your parameters# This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI. To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the HTTP Request node, which should provide a more detailed error message. Referenced node is unexecuted# This error displays when a previous node in the workflow hasn't executed and isn't providing output that this node needs as input. The full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format: 1 An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first. To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node. For nodes that call JavaScript or other custom code, determine if a node has executed before trying to use the value by calling: 1 $(\"<node-name>\").isExecuted"

    "content": "Webhook node# Use the Webhook node to create webhooks, which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow. You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint. The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node. Workflow development process# n8n provides different Webhook URLs for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to Listen for test event. Refer to Workflow development for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production. Node parameters# Use these parameters to configure your node. Webhook URLs# The Webhook node has two Webhook URLs: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select Test URL or Production URL to toggle which URL n8n displays. Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab Test: n8n registers a test webhook when you select Listen for Test Event or Test workflow, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow. Production: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the Executions tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view. HTTP Method# The Webhook node supports standard HTTP Request Methods: DELETE GET HEAD PATCH POST PUT Webhook max payload The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB. If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the endpoint environment variable N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX. Path# By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes. You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs. The Path field can take the following formats: /:variable /path/:variable /:variable/path /:variable1/path/:variable2 /:variable1/:variable2 Supported authentication methods# You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods: Basic auth Header auth JWT auth None Refer to Webhook credentials for more information on setting up each credential type. Respond# Immediately: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message Workflow got started. When Last Node Finishes: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node: The Webhook node responds as defined in the Respond to Webhook node. Response Code# Customize the HTTP response code that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code. Response Data# Choose what data to include in the response body: All Entries: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array. First Entry JSON: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object. First Entry Binary: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file. No Response Body: The Webhook returns without a body. Applies only to Respond > When Last Node Finishes. Node options# Select Add Option to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability. Allowed Origins (CORS): Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use * (default) to allow all origins. Binary Property: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. Ignore Bots: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers. IP(s) Whitelist: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL. No Response Body: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response. Raw Body: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML. Response Content-Type: Choose the format for the webhook body. Response Data: Send custom data with the response. Response Headers: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to MDN Web Docs | Response header to learn more about response headers.

To do this: Create an Airtable account. In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, beginner course. Create an Airtable base In the beginner course base, by default, you have a table called Table 1 with four fields: Name, Notes, Assignee, and Status. These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our \"orders\" data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result.

Delete the Notes, Assignee, and Status fields. Edit the Name field (the primary field) to read orderID, with the Number field type. Add the rest of the fields, and their field types, using the table below as a reference: Field name Field type orderID Number customerID Number employeeName Single line text orderPrice Number orderStatus Single line text Now your table should look like this: Orders table in Airtable Now that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI. Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node# Add an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node. Remember You can add a node connected to an existing node by selecting the + icon next to the existing node. In the node panel: Search for Airtable. Select Create a record from the Record Actions search results. This will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window. In the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters: Credential to connect with: Select Create new credential. Keep the default option Connect using: Access Token selected. Access token: Follow the instructions from the Airtable credential page to create your token. Use the recommended scopes and add access to your beginners course base. Save the credential and close the Credential window when you're finished. Resource: Record. Operation: Create. This operation will create new records in the table. Base: You can pick your base from a list (for example, beginner course). Table: orders. Mapping Column Mode: Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields must have the same as the columns in Airtable. Test the Airtable node# Once you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting Test step. This might take a moment to process, but you can follow the progress by viewing the base in Airtable. Your results should look like this: Airtable node results All 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable: Imported records in the orders table What's next?# Nathan 🙋: Wow, this automation is already so useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable. Remember that I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table and calculate the price of booked orders? You 👩‍🔧: Sure, no problem. As a next step, I'll use a new node to filter the orders based on their status."

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item.

    "content": "Chat Trigger node common issues# Here are some common errors and issues with the Chat Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node# When embedding the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie. To do this, use the metadata field in the JSON object you pass to the createChat function in your embedded chat window: 1 2 3 4 5 6 createChat({ webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL', metadata: { 'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA' }; }); The metadata field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using n8n's data processing features. Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages# When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a workflow could not be started! error. In Chat Triggers, the Load Previous Session option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the sessionID. When you set the Load Previous Session option to From memory, it's almost always best to connect the same memory node to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow: In your Chat Trigger node, set the Load Previous Session option to From Memory. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available. Attach a Simple Memory node to the Memory connector. Attach the same Simple Memory node to Memory connector of your Agent. In the Simple Memory node, set Session ID to Connected Chat Trigger Node. One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the Session ID in your memory node to Define below. If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis."

    "content": "Postgres node common issues# Here are some common errors and issues with the Postgres node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Dynamically populate SQL IN groups with parameters# In Postgres, you can use the SQL IN comparison construct to make comparisons between groups of values: 1 SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large'); While you can use n8n expressions in your query to dynamically populate the values in an IN group, combining this with query parameters provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input. To construct an IN group query with query parameters: Set the Operation to Execute Query. In Options, select Query Parameters. Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, {{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}. In the Query parameter, write your query with the IN construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example: 1 SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN (); Inside of the IN parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like $1, $2, and $3) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed: 1 SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => \"$\" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }}); With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of prepared statement placeholders for the IN values according to the number of items in your array. Working with timestamps and time zones# To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips: Use UTC when storing and passing dates: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems. Set the execution timezone: Set the global timezone in n8n using either environment variables (for self-hosted) or in the settings (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the workflow settings. Use ISO 8601 format: The ISO 8601 format encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses Luxon to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the Date & Time node and a custom format set to the string yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss."

Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool# You can connect the Simple Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an AI agent to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries. Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Simple Vector Store node. Use a retriever to fetch documents# You can use the Vector Store Retriever node with the Simple Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Simple Vector Store node. This is often used with the Question and Answer Chain node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input. An example of the connection flow (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector Store. Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions# Another pattern uses the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to summarize results and answer questions from the Simple Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Simple Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store. The connections flow in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store. Memory Management# The Simple Vector Store implements memory management to prevent excessive memory usage: Automatically cleans up old vector stores when memory pressure increases Removes inactive stores that haven't been accessed for a configurable amount of time Each workflow gets its own isolated storage space identified by the workflow ID and memory key Configuration Options# You can control memory usage with these environment variables: Variable Type Default Description N8N_VECTOR_STORE_MAX_MEMORY Number -1 Maximum memory in MB allowed for all vector stores combined (-1 to disable limits). N8N_VECTOR_STORE_TTL_HOURS Number -1 Hours of inactivity after which a store gets removed (-1 to disable TTL). On n8n Cloud, these values are preset to 100MB (about 8,000 documents, depending on document size and metadata) and 7 days respectively. For self-hosted instances, both values default to -1(no memory limits or time-based cleanup). Node parameters# Operation Mode# This Vector Store node has four modes: Get Many, Insert Documents, Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool), and Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent). The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available. Get Many# In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context. Insert Documents# Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details. Get Many parameters# Memory Key: Enter the key to use to store the vector memory in the workflow data. n8n prefixes the key with the workflow ID to avoid collisions. Prompt: Enter the search query. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Insert Documents parameters# Memory Key: Enter the key to use to store the vector memory in the workflow data. n8n prefixes the key with the workflow ID to avoid collisions. Clear Store: Use this parameter to control whether to wipe the vector store for the given memory key for this workflow before inserting data (turned on). Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters# Memory Key: Enter the key to use to store the vector memory in the workflow data. n8n prefixes the key with the workflow ID to avoid collisions. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters# Name: The name of the vector store. Description: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often. Memory Key: Enter the key to use to store the vector memory in the workflow data. n8n prefixes the key with the workflow ID to avoid collisions. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Anthropic Chat Model node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node parameters# Model: Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from: Claude Claude Instant Learn more in the Anthropic model documentation. Node options# Maximum Number of Tokens: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

The workflow must be active and called by a trigger or webhook to save static data. This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions. You can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small. As an example: you can save a timestamp of the last item processed from an RSS feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n checks automatically if the data has changed and saves it, if necessary. There are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again. Example with global data: JavaScript Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // Get the global workflow static data const workflowStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('global'); // Access its data const lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution; // Update its data workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime(); // Delete data delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution; Example with node data: JavaScript Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // Get the static data of the node const nodeStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('node'); // Access its data const lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution; // Update its data nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime(); // Delete data delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution; Templates and examples# View template details"

User data# n8n recommends that you follow the same or similar practices used internally for n8n Cloud: Save user data using Rook and, if an n8n server goes down, a new instance starts on another machine using the same data. Due to this, you don't need to use backups except in case of a catastrophic failure, or when a user wants to reactivate their account within your prescribed retention period (two weeks for n8n Cloud). Backups# n8n recommends creating nightly backups by attaching another container, and copying all data to this second container. In this manner, RAM usage is negligible, and so doesn't impact the amount of users you can place on the server. Restarting# If your instance is down or restarting, missed executions (for example, Cron or Webhook nodes) during this time aren't recoverable. If it's important for you to maintain 100% uptime, you need to build another proxy in front of it which caches the data."

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node usage patterns# You can use the PGVector Vector Store node in the following patterns. Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents# You can use the PGVector Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the PGVector Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent. You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of this template (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same). Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool# You can connect the PGVector Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an AI agent to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries. Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> PGVector Vector Store node. Use a retriever to fetch documents# You can use the Vector Store Retriever node with the PGVector Vector Store node to fetch documents from the PGVector Vector Store node. This is often used with the Question and Answer Chain node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input. An example of the connection flow (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> PGVector Vector Store. Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions# Another pattern uses the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to summarize results and answer questions from the PGVector Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the PGVector Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store. The connections flow (the linked example uses the Simple Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store. Node parameters# Operation Mode# This Vector Store node has four modes: Get Many, Insert Documents, Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool), and Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent). The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available. Get Many# In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context. Insert Documents# Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details. Get Many parameters# Table name: Enter the name of the table you want to query. Prompt: Enter your search query. Limit: Enter a number to set how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Insert Documents parameters# Table name: Enter the name of the table you want to query. Retrieve Documents parameters (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Table name: Enter the name of the table you want to query. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters# Name: The name of the vector store. Description: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often. Table Name: Enter the PGVector table to use. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Node options# Collection# A way to separate datasets in PGVector. This creates a separate table and column to keep track of which collection a vector belongs to. Use Collection: Select whether to use a collection (turned on) or not (turned off). Collection Name: Enter the name of the collection you want to use. Collection Table Name: Enter the name of the table to store collection information in. Column Names# The following options specify the names of the columns to store the vectors and corresponding information in: ID Column Name Vector Column Name Content Column Name Metadata Column Name Metadata Filter# Available in Get Many mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document. This is an AND query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match. When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to Default Data Loader for more information on loading documents.

This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.

Release date: 2022-07-20 This release includes several major new features, including: The community nodes repository: a new way to build and share nodes. Data pinning and data mapping: accelerate workflow development with better data manipulation functionality. New features# Community nodes repository# This release introduces the community node repository. This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n. Data pinning# Data pinning allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development. Data mapping# This release introduces a drag and drop interface for data mapping, as a quick way to map data without using expressions. Simplify authentication setup for node creators# This release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an authenticate property that dictates how the credential is used in a request. n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as \"generic\", and use the IAuthenticateGeneric interface. You can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth. For an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's Asana node. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 // in AsanaApi.credentials.ts import { IAuthenticateGeneric, ICredentialType, INodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow'; export class AsanaApi implements ICredentialType { name = 'asanaApi'; displayName = 'Asana API'; documentationUrl = 'asana'; properties: INodeProperties[] = [ { displayName: 'Access Token', name: 'accessToken', type: 'string', default: '', }, ]; authenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { type: 'generic', properties: { headers: { Authorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.accessToken}}', }, }, }; } Other new features# Added a preAuthentication method to credentials. Added more credentials tests. Introduce automatic fixing for paired item information in some scenarios. Node enhancements# ERPNext node: add credential tests, and add support for unauthorized certs. Google Drive node: add support for move to trash. Mindee node: support new version. Notion node: support ignoring the Notion URL property if empty. Shopify node: add OAuth support.

Release date: 2022-05-24 This is a bug fix release. It solves an issue with setting credentials in the HTTP Request node. n8n@0.178.0# View the commits for this version. Release date: 2022-05-24 This release adds support for reusing existing credentials in the HTTP Request node, making it easier to do custom operation with APIs where n8n already has an integration. The release also includes improvements to the nodes view, giving better detail about incoming data, as well as some bug fixes. New features# Credential reuse for custom API operations# n8n supplies hundreds of nodes, allowing you to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node. One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node. For more information, refer to Custom API operations.

This release contains new features, new nodes, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Model Context Protocol (MCP) nodes# MCP aims to standardise how LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor can interact with tools or integrate data for their agents. Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system. While it’s still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker. We are adding two new nodes: a MCP Server Trigger for any workflow a MCP Client Tool for the AI Agent The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface. Max from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started: Studio Update #04 MCP Server Trigger# The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat. MCP Server Trigger Explore the MCP Server Trigger docs MCP Client Tool# The MCP Client Tool node is a MCP client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents. In this regard it is similar to using a n8n tool with your AI agent. One advantage is that the MCP Client Tool can access multiple tools on the MCP server at once, keeping your canvas cleaner and easier to understand.

Well, they’re super handy for categorizing just about everything and they’re finally available for your n8n workflows. Tidy up your workspace with unlimited folders and nested folders. Search for workflows within folders. It’s one of the ways we’re making it easier to organize your n8n instances more effectively. How to use it: Create and manage folders within your personal space or within projects. You can also create workflows from within a folder. You may need to restart your instance in order to activate folders. It's a folder alright Folders are available for all registered users so get started with decluttering your workspace now and look for more features (like drag and drop) to organize your instances soon. Enhancements to Form Trigger Node# Recent updates to the Form Trigger node have made it a more powerful tool for building business solutions. These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms. HTML customization: Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences. Custom CSS support: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand’s look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity. Form previews: Your form’s description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look. Hidden fields: Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data—such as a referral source—without exposing it to the user. New responses options: Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates. Form with custom CSS applied These improvements elevate the Form Trigger node beyond a simple workflow trigger, transforming it into a powerful tool for addressing use cases from data collection and order processing to custom content creation.

Schema Preview# Schema Preview lets you view and work with a node’s expected output without executing it or adding credentials, keeping you in flow while building. See expected node outputs instantly. View schemas for over 100+ nodes to help you design workflows efficiently without extra steps. Define workflow logic first, take care of credentials later. Build your end-to-end workflow without getting sidetracked by credential setup. Avoid unwanted executions when building. Prevent unnecessary API calls, unwanted data changes, or potential third-party service costs by viewing outputs without executing nodes. How to use it: Add a node with Schema Preview support to your workflow. Open the next node in the sequence - Schema Preview data appears in the Node Editor where you would typically find it in the Schema View. Use Schema Preview fields just like other schema data - drag and drop them into parameters and settings as needed. Don’t forget to add the required credentials before putting your workflow into production.

Tidy up# Tidy up instantly aligns nodes, centers stickies, untangles connections, and brings structure to your workflows. Whether you're preparing to share a workflow or just want to improve readability, this feature saves you time and makes your logic easier to follow. Clean, well-organized workflows aren't just nicer to look at—they’re also quicker to understand. How to: Open the workflow you want to tidy, then choose one of these options: Click the Tidy up button in the bottom-left corner of the canvas (it looks like a broom 🧹) Press Shift + Alt + T on your keyboard Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select Tidy up workflow Want to tidy up just part of your workflow? Select the specific nodes you want to clean up first - Tidy up will only adjust those, along with any stickies behind them. Multiple API keys# n8n now supports multiple API keys, allowing users to generate and manage separate keys for different workflows or integrations. This improves security by enabling easier key rotation and isolation of credentials. Future updates will introduce more granular controls.

Improved partial executions# The new execution engine for partial executions ensures that testing parts of a workflow in the builder closely mirrors production behaviour. This makes iterating with updated run-data faster and more reliable, particularly for complex workflows. Before, user would test parts of a workflow in the builder that didn't consistently reflect production behaviour, leading to unexpected results during development. This update aligns workflow execution in the builder with production behavior.

Improved consistency across environments# We added new UX and automatic changes improvements resulting in a better consistency between your staging and production instances. Previously, users faced issues like: Lack of visibility into required credential updates when pulling changes Incomplete synchronization, where changes — such as deletions — weren’t always applied across environments Confusing commit process, making it unclear what was being pushed or pulled We addressed these by: Clearly indicating required credential updates when pulling changes Ensuring deletions and other modifications sync correctly across environments Improving commit selection to provide better visibility into what’s being pushed Commit modal Pull notification For full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub. n8n@1.74.1# View the commits for this version.

Release date: 2024-12-04 This release contains node updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Task runners for the Code node in public beta# We're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation. Task runners overview Our benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same. The Task runner comes in two modes: Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using environment variables. Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes. To start using Task runners today, check out the docs. Node updates# AI Transform node: We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data Code node: We added a warning if pairedItem is absent or could not be auto mapped For full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub. n8n@1.70.2# View the commits for this version.

Release date: 2024-10-24 Breaking change What changed? Queue polling via the environment variable QUEUE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL has been removed. When is action necessary? If you have set QUEUE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL, you can remove it as it no longer has any effect. This release contains a new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes. New node: n8n Form# Use the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple pages. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a n8n Form Trigger. A multi-page form with branching Additionally you can: Set default selections with query parameters Define the form with a JSON array of objects Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL Node updates# New nodes: Google Business Profile and Google Business Profile Trigger: Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows Enhanced nodes: AI Agent: Removed the requirement to add at least one tool GitHub: Added workflows as a resource operation Structured Output Parser: Added more user-friendly error messages For additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API.

Release date: 2024-10-16 This release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes. Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates# The Remove Duplicates node got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations: Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions. This makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by id or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their order date. The great thing is, you can now do this within and across workflow runs. New node: Gong# The new node for Gong allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows. For full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub. Contributors# Sören Uhrbach n8n@1.63.4# View the commits for this version.

Release date: 2024-10-09 Breaking change What changed? The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default. The worker server's /healthz used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of /healthz/readiness. When is action necessary? If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT. If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking /healthz/readiness instead of /healthz. This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes. Node updates# OpenAI: Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID Gmail and Slack: Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow We have also optimized the worker health checks (see breaking change above). Each credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier. For full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.

Skipped 1.62.0 We skipped 1.62.0 and went straight to 1.62.1 with an additional fix. Additional nodes as tools# We have made additional nodes usable with the Tools AI Agent node. Additionally, we have added a $fromAI() placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n. Both of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before. Node updates# Google BigQuery: Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings HTTP Request: Added credential support for Sysdig Invoice Ninja: Additional query params for getAll requests Question and Answer Chain: Added the option to use a custom prompt Drag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes. Customers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an Execution Data Node (or Code node) to the workflow to set custom executions data. For full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.

Backup recommended Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version. Credential sharing required for manual executions Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to share the credential with you. New feature: Projects# With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team. Refer to the RBAC documentation for information on creating projects and using roles. The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to Pricing for details. New node: Slack Trigger# This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the Slack Trigger documentation for details. Other highlights# Improved memory support for OpenAI assistants. Rolling back to a previous version# If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back: Self-hosted n8n: Delete any RBAC projects you created. Revert the database migrations using n8n db:revert. Cloud: contact help@n8n.io.

New feature: Ask AI in the HTTP node# You can now ask AI to help create API requests in the HTTP Request node: In the HTTP Request node, select Ask AI. Enter the Service and Request you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter NASA in Service and get picture of the day in Request. Check the parameters: the AI tries to fill them out, but you may still need to adjust or correct the configuration. Self-hosted users need to enable AI features and provide their own API keys New node: Groq Chat Model# This release adds the Groq Chat Model node.

To enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list. Node options# Continue if Field Not Found# By default, if a Field to Summarize isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off). Disable Dot Notation# By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format parent.child. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off). Output Format# Select the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using Fields to Split By Each Split in a Separate Item: Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field. All Splits in a Single Item: Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields. Ignore items without valid fields to group by# Set whether to ignore input items that don't contain the Fields to Split By (turned on) or not (turned off).

Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same user-defined bridge network if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file. When configuring Supabase credentials, use the Supabase API gateway container's name (supabase-kong by default) as the host address instead of localhost. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the Host to http://supabase-kong:8000. Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase# If queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the Postgres node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policy. Supabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public anon key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to. To access data from a table with RLS enabled as the anon role, create a policy to enable the access patterns you intend to use."

Function and Function Item nodes The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the Function node documentation and Function Item node documentation. Usage# How to use the Code node. Choose a mode# There are two modes: Run Once for All Items: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are. Run Once for Each Item: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item. JavaScript# The Code node supports Node.js. Supported JavaScript features# The Code node supports: Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly. Writing to your browser console using console.log. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows. External libraries# If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the Enable modules in Code node guide. If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you: crypto Node.js module moment npm package Built-in methods and variables# n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data.

    "content": "Navigating the Editor UI# In this lesson you will learn how to navigate the Editor UI. We will walk through the canvas and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n. n8n version This course is based on n8n version 1.82.1. In other versions, some user interfaces might look different, but this shouldn't impact the core functionality. Getting started# Begin by setting up n8n. We recommend starting with n8n Cloud, a hosted solution that doesn't require installation and includes a free trial. Alternative set up If n8n Cloud isn't a good option for you, you can self-host with Docker. This is an advanced option recommended only for technical users familiar with hosting services, Docker, and the command line. For more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our platforms documentation. Once you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. Log in to your n8n instance. Select Overview and then Create Workflow to view the main canvas. It should look like this: Editor UI Editor UI settings# The editor UI is the web interface where you build workflows. You can access all your workflows and credentials, as well as support pages, from the Editor UI. Left-side panel# On the left side of the Editor UI, there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon. The panel contains the following sections: Overview: Contains all the workflows and credentials you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here. Projects: (Not available on Community edition) Projects group workflows and credentials. You can assign roles to users in a project to control what they can do in a project. A Personal project is available by default. Admin Panel: n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings. Templates: A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases. Variables: Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans. All executions: Contains information about your workflow executions. Help: Contains resources around n8n product and community. Update: (When updates are available) Indicator for any recent product updates. Settings: Under the ellipsis (...) menu by your username. Manage users and access settings for a variety of features. Editor UI left-side menu Top bar# The top bar of the Editor UI contains the following information: Workflow Name: By default, n8n names a new workflow as \"My workflow\", but you can edit the name at any time. + Add Tag: Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional. Inactive/active toggle: This button activates or deactivates the current workflow. By default, workflows are deactivated. Share: You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans. Save: This button saves the current workflow. History: Once you save your workflow, you can view previous versions here. Editor UI top bar Canvas# The canvas is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities: Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, and tidy up the nodes on screen. A button to Test workflow once you add your first node. When you click on it, n8n executes all nodes on the canvas in sequence. A button with a + sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel. A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a sticky note to the canvas (visible when hovering on the top right + icon). A dotted square with the text \"Add first step.\" This is where you add your first node. Workflow canvas Moving the canvas You can move the workflow canvas around in three ways: Select Ctrl+Left Button on the canvas and move it around. Select Middle Button on the canvas and move it around. Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide. Don't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course. Nodes# You can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow. Node A node is an individual step in your workflow: one that either (a) loads, (b) processes, or (c) sends data. Based on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types: App or Action Nodes add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the Action nodes library for a full list of these nodes. Trigger Nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the Trigger nodes library for a list of trigger nodes. Core Nodes can be trigger or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the Core Nodes library for a full list of core nodes. Cluster Nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow, primarily for AI workflows. Refer to Cluster nodes for more information. Learn more Refer to Node types for a more detailed explanation of all node types. Finding nodes# You can find all available nodes in the nodes panel on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel: Click the + icon in the top right corner of the canvas. Click the + icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one). Click the Tab key on your keyboard. Nodes panel In the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Advanced AI, Actions in an App, Data transformation, Flow, Core, and Human in the loop nodes. If you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel. Adding nodes# There are two ways to add nodes to your canvas: Select the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas. Drag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas. Node buttons# If you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top: Execute the node (Play icon) Deactivate/Activate the node (Power icon) Delete the node (Trash icon) There will also be an ellipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other node options. Moving a workflow To move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes with your mouse or Ctrl+A, select and hold on a node, then drag it to any point you want on the canvas. Summary# In this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas. In the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far."

    "content": "Push and pull# If your n8n instance connects to a Git repository, you need to keep your work in sync with Git. This document assumes some familiarity with Git concepts and terminology. Refer to Git and n8n for an introduction to how n8n works with Git. Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both. Fetch other people's work# Restricted feature Ordinary users can't fetch work from Git. You must be an n8n instance owner, admin, or project owner to fetch work from Git. To pull work from Git, select Pull in the main menu. View screenshot n8n may display a warning about overriding local changes. Select Pull and override to override your local work with the content in Git. When the changes include new variable or credential stubs, n8n notifies you that you need to populate the values for the items before using them. How deleted resources are handled When workflows, credentials, variables, and tags are deleted from the repository, your local versions of these resources aren't deleted automatically. Instead, when you pull repository changes, n8n notifies you about any outdated resources and asks if you'd like to delete them. Workflow and credential owner may change on pull# When you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project. If the original owner is a user: If the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner. If the original owner is a project: n8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project. Pulling may cause brief service interruption# If you pull changes to an active workflow, n8n sets the workflow to inactive while pulling, then reactivates it. This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow. Send your work to Git# Restricted feature Ordinary users can't send work to Git. You must be an n8n instance owner, admin, or project owner to send work to Git. To push work to Git: Select Push in the main menu. View screenshot In the Commit and push changes modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making. Select Commit and Push. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion. What gets committed# n8n commits the following to Git: Workflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push. Credential stubs (ID, name, type) Variable stubs (ID and name) Projects Folders You can programmatically Manage variables using the n8n API. Merge behaviors and conflicts# n8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows. Workflows# You have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth. When pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling. When you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes. To prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull. To avoid losing data: Design your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them. Don't push all workflows. Select the ones you need. Be cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository. Credentials, variables and workflow tags# Credentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep. On pull: If the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it. If the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless: You set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value. The credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git. The name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process. On push: n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files. If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull. Manage credentials with an external secrets vault If you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use external secrets."

Function and Function Item nodes The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the Function node documentation and Function Item node documentation. Usage# How to use the Code node. Choose a mode# There are two modes: Run Once for All Items: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are. Run Once for Each Item: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item. JavaScript# The Code node supports Node.js. Supported JavaScript features# The Code node supports: Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly. Writing to your browser console using console.log. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows. External libraries# If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the Enable modules in Code node guide. If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you: crypto Node.js module moment npm package Built-in methods and variables# n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information. The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is $variableName or $methodName(). Type $ in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables. Keyboard shortcuts# The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the list of keyboard shortcuts. Python# n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using Pyodide, which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the Packages included with Pyodide. n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is _variableName or _methodName(). Type _ in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables. Keyboard shortcuts# The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. A full list can be found in the list of keyboard shortcuts. File system and HTTP requests# You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead: Read/Write File From Disk HTTP Request Coding in n8n# There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks. Key concepts# When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts: Data structure: understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node. Item linking: learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match. Built-in methods and variables# n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for: Accessing specific item data Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment Convenience variables to help with data and time Refer to Built-in methods and variables for more information. Use AI in the Code node# Feature availability AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n. AI generated code overwrites your code If you've already written some code on the Code tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed. To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node: In the Code node, set Language to JavaScript. Select the Ask AI tab. Write your query. Select Generate Code. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the Code tab."

    "h1": "Your first workflow#",
    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/tutorial-first-workflow/",
    "content": "Your first workflow# This guide will show you how to construct a workflow in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will: Create a workflow from scratch. Understand key concepts and skills, including: Starting workflows with trigger nodes Configuring credentials Processing data Representing logic in an n8n workflow Using expressions This quickstart uses n8n Cloud, which is recommended for new users. A free trial is available - if you haven't already done so, sign up for an account now. Step one: Create a new workflow# When you open n8n, you'll see either: A window with a welcome message and two large buttons: Choose Start from Scratch to create a new workflow. The Workflows list on the Overview page. Select the Create Workflow to create a new workflow. Step two: Add a trigger node# n8n provides two ways to start a workflow: Manually, by selecting Test Workflow. Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings. For this tutorial, we'll use the Schedule trigger. This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule: Select Add first step. Search for Schedule. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search. Select Schedule Trigger to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node. For Trigger Interval, select Weeks. For Weeks Between Triggers, enter 1. Enter a time and day. For this example, select Monday in Trigger on Weekdays, select 9am in Trigger at Hour, and enter 0 in Trigger at Minute. Close the node details view to return to the canvas. Step three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials# The NASA node interacts with NASA's public APIs to fetch useful data. We will use the real-time data from the API to find solar events. Credentials Select the Add node connector on the Schedule Trigger node. Search for NASA. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search. Select NASA to view a list of operations. Search for and select Get a DONKI solar flare. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it. To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials: Select the Credential for NASA API dropdown. Select Create new credential. n8n opens the credentials view. Go to NASA APIs and fill out the form from the Generate API Key link. The NASA site generates the key and emails it to the address you entered. Check your email account for the API key. Copy the key, and paste it into API Key in n8n. Select Save. Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in Credential for NASA API. By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use Additional Fields: Select Add field. Select Start date. To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to Start date, select the Expression tab, then select the expand button to open the full expressions editor. In the Expression field, enter the following expression: 1 {{ $today.minus(7, 'days') }} This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date. Date and time formats in n8n... Close the Edit Expression modal to return to the NASA node. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select Test step to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the OUTPUT section. Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas. Step four: Add logic with the If node# n8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial we will use the If node to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications; we will add logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another. Add the If node: Select the Add node connector on the NASA node. Search for If. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search. Select If to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node. You need to check the value of the classType property in the NASA data. To do this: Drag classType into Value 1. Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step. Change the comparison operation to String > Contains. In Value 2, enter X. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select Test step to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the OUTPUT panel. Weeks without large solar flares In this tutorial, you are working with live data. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing X in Value 2 with either A, B, C, or M. Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas. Step five: Output data from your workflow# The last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to Postbin. Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page. On the If node, select the Add node connector labeled true. Search for PostBin. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search. Select PostBin. Select Send a request. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it. Go to Postbin and select Create Bin. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow. Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to 1651063625300-2016451240051. In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into Bin ID. Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to Bin Content, select the Expression tab (you will need to mouse-over the Bin Content for the tab to appear), then select the expand button to open the full expressions editor. You can now click and drag the correct field from the If Node output into the expressions editor to automatically create a reference for this label. In this case the input we want is 'classType'. Once dropped into the expressions editor it will transform into this reference: {{$json[\"classType\"]}}. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is: 1 There was a solar flare of class {{$json[\"classType\"]}} Close the expressions editor to return to the node. Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas. Add another Postbin node, to handle the false output path from the If node: Hover over the Postbin node, then select Node context menu > Duplicate node to duplicate the first Postbin node. Drag the false connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node. Step six: Test the workflow# You can now test the entire workflow. Select Test Workflow. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress. Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output. If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the Active toggle. Time limit Postbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit. Congratulations# You now have a fully functioning workflow that does something useful! It should look something like this: View workflow file Along the way you have discovered: How to find the nodes you want and join them together How to use expressions to manipulate data How to create credentials and attach them to nodes How to use logic in your workflows There are plenty of things you could add to this (perhaps add some more credentials and a node to send you an email of the results), or maybe you have a specific project in mind.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenAI Chat Model node and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name.

Load data into sub-workflow before building This requires the ability to load data from previous executions, which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans. If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it: Create the sub-workflow and add the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger. Set the node's Input data mode to Accept all data or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known. In the sub-workflow settings, set Save successful production executions to Save. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it. Follow the steps to load data from previous executions. Adjust the Input data mode to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary. You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow. Call the sub-workflow# Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow. Add the Execute Sub-workflow node. In the Execute Sub-workflow node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL. Find your workflow ID Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow. Save your workflow. When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it. You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the View sub-execution link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction. Templates and examples# Browse Execute Sub-workflow Trigger integration templates, or search all templates How data passes between workflows# As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called Workflow B: The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled \"When executed by another node\" in the canvas) of Workflow B. The last node of Workflow B sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A."

Used to reference it from other places in the node. icon# String or Object | Required Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file. You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes. If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with file:, indicating the path to the icon file. For example: 1 icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg' To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with light and dark properties. For example: 1 2 3 4 icon: { light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg', dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg' } n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio. Don't reference Font Awesome If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image. group# Array of strings | Required Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are: trigger: node waits for a trigger. schedule: node waits for a timer to expire. input, output, transform: these currently have no effect. An empty array, []. Use this as the default option if you don't need trigger or schedule. description# String | Required A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI. defaults# Object | Required Contains essential brand and name settings. The object can include: name: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the displayName is too long. color: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n. forceInputNodeExecution# Boolean | Optional When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is false (requiring only one input branch to run). inputs# Array of strings | Required Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use input: ['main']. outputs# Array of strings | Required Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use output: ['main']. requiredInputs# Integer or Array | Optional Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute. credentials# Array of objects | Required This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type. The object must include: name: the credential name. Must match the name property in the credential file. For example, name: 'asanaApi' in Asana.node.ts links to name = 'asanaApi' in AsanaApi.credential.ts. required: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node. requestDefaults# Object | Required Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes. This object must include: baseURL: The API base URL. You can also add: headers: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type. url: string. Appended to the baseURL. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the operations. properties# Array of objects | Required This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input. Resource objects# A resource object includes the following parameters: displayName: String. This should always be Resource. name: String. This should always be resource. type: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, options results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to Node UI elements for more information. noDataExpression: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be true for resource. Operations objects# The operations object defines the available operations on a resource. displayName: String. This should always be Options. name: String. This should always be option. type: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, dateTime results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to Node UI elements for more information. noDataExpression: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be true for operation. options: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An options object includes: name. String. value. String. action: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called \"Card\" and an operation \"Get all\", your action is \"Get all cards\". description: String. routing: Object containing request details. Additional fields objects# These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under Additional Fields in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.

This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node. This document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to: Item linking for node creators, for details on how to handle item linking when building a node. Item linking in the Code node, to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node. Item linking errors, to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI. n8n's automatic item linking# If a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically: Single input, single output: the output links to the input. Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input. Multiple inputs and outputs: If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information. If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on. If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items. If n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to Item linking errors for more information. Item linking example# In this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors. The methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources: Mapping in the UI Mapping in the expressions editor Item linking in the Code node Item linking errors"

You must also enter either: From list: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account. Workflow ID: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after /workflow/. For example, if the URL of a workflow is https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7, the Workflow ID is abCDE1f6gHiJKL7.

Parameter: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter: Workflow JSON: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute. URL: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter: Workflow URL: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from. Workflow Inputs# If you select a sub-workflow using the database and From list options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values. You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives null as the item's value. You can also enable Attempt to convert types to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type. Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the \"Accept all data\" input data mode. Mode# Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options: Run once with all items: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node. Run once for each item: Execute the node once for each input item in turn. Node options# This node includes one option: Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

Create sub-workflows from existing workflows You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the Execute Sub-workflow node. In the node, select the Database and From list options and select Create a sub-workflow in the list. Optional: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow: Select the Options menu > Settings. n8n opens the Workflow settings modal. Change the This workflow can be called by setting. Refer to Workflow settings for more information on configuring your workflows. Add the Execute Sub-workflow trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled When Executed by Another Workflow). Set the Input data mode to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data: Define using fields below: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. Define using JSON example: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types. Accept all data: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality. Save the sub-workflow. Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it. Load data into sub-workflow before building This requires the ability to load data from previous executions, which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans. If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it: Create the sub-workflow and add the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger. Set the node's Input data mode to Accept all data or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known. In the sub-workflow settings, set Save successful production executions to Save. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it. Follow the steps to load data from previous executions. Adjust the Input data mode to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary. You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow. Call the sub-workflow# Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow. Add the Execute Sub-workflow node. In the Execute Sub-workflow node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL. Find your workflow ID Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow. Save your workflow. When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it. You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the View sub-execution link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction. How data passes between workflows# As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called Workflow B: The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled \"When executed by another node\" in the canvas) of Workflow B. The last node of Workflow B sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in Workflow A."

Using app access token# To configure this credential, you'll need a Meta for Developers account and: An app Access Token An optional App Secret: Used to verify the integrity and origin of the payload. There are five steps in setting up your credential: Create a Meta app with the Webhooks product. Generate an App Access Token for that app. Configure the Facebook trigger. Optional: Add an app secret. App Review: Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary. Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step. Create a Meta app# To create a Meta app: Go to the Meta Developer App Dashboard and select Create App. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet and select Next. The Use cases page opens. Select Other, then select Next. Select Business and Next. Complete the essential information: Add an App name. Add an App contact email. Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it. Select Create app. The Add products to your app page opens. Select App settings > Basic from the left menu. Enter a Privacy Policy URL. (Required to take the app \"Live.\") Select Save changes. At the top of the page, toggle the App Mode from Development to Live. In the left menu, select Add Product. The Add products to your app page appears. Select Webhooks. The Webhooks product opens. Refer to Meta's Create an app documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products. For more information on the app modes and switching to Live mode, refer to App Modes and Publish | App Types. Generate an App Access Token# Next, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product: In a separate tab or window, open the Graph API explorer. Select the Meta App you just created in the Access Token section. In User or Page, select Get App Token. Select Generate Access Token. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts. App unavailable You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the Access Token. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration. Save your n8n credential. Refer to the Meta instructions for Your First Request for more information on generating the token. Configure the Facebook Trigger# Now that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node: In your Meta app, copy the App ID from the top navigation bar. In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node. Paste the App ID into the APP ID field. Select Test step to shift the trigger into listening mode. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's Webhooks product configuration is open. Subscribe to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription: Copy the Webhook URL from n8n and enter it as the Callback URL in your Meta App. Enter the Access Token you copied above as the Verify token. Select Verify and save. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.) Some webhook subscriptions, like User, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in. You can send some Test events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n. Refer to the Facebook Trigger node documentation for more information. Optional: Add an App Secret# For added security, Meta recommends adding an App Secret. This signs all API calls with the appsecret_proof parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key. To generate an App Secret: In Meta while viewing your app, select App settings > Basic from the left menu. Select Show next to the App secret field. The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret. Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the App Secret. Save your n8n credential. Refer to the App Secret documentation for more information. App review# App Review requires Business Verification. Your app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who: Doesn't have a role on the app itself. Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app. If your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required. As part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions. Refer to Meta's App Review and Advanced Access documentation for more information.

For example, refer to Wasabi's REST API documentation or DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation. Using S3 endpoint# To configure this credential, you'll need: An S3 Endpoint: Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend. A Region: Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the \"region slug.\" An Access Key ID: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys. A Secret Access Key: Enter the secret access key for the Access Key ID. Force Path Style: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets. Ignore SSL Issues: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails. More detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information. Using DigitalOcean Spaces# To configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces: In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open Settings. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend https:// to that endpoint and enter it as the S3 Endpoint in n8n. Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in. For the Region, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, nyc3. If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter us-east-1 instead.

Keep the Force Path Style toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL: To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of Ignore SSL Issues turned off. To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on Ignore SSL Issues. Refer to DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation for more information. Using Wasabi# To configure the credential for use with Wasabi: For the S3 Endpoint, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with https://. Refer to What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions? to identify the correct URL. For the Region, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com as the S3 Endpoint, us-east-2 is the region. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user. Open the Menu and select Access Keys. Select CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY. Select whether the key is for the Root User or a Sub-User and select CREATE. Copy the Access Key and enter it in n8n as the Access Key ID. Copy the Secret Key and enter it in n8n as the Secret Access Key. Refer to Creating a Wasabi API Access Key Set for more information on generating the key and secret. Wasabi recommends turning on the Force Path Style toggle \"because the path-style offers the greatest flexibility in bucket names, avoiding domain name issues.\" Refer to the Wasabi REST API Introduction for more information.

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoresupabase/",
    "content": "Supabase Vector Store node# Use the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as vector store. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain, or connect it directly to an agent to use as a tool. On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Supabase node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Supabase provides a quickstart for setting up your vector store. If you use settings other than the defaults in the quickstart, this may affect parameter settings in n8n. Make sure you understand what you're doing. Node usage patterns# You can use the Supabase Vector Store node in the following patterns. Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents# You can use the Supabase Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Supabase Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent. You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of this template. Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool# You can connect the Supabase Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an AI agent to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries. Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Supabase Vector Store node. Use a retriever to fetch documents# You can use the Vector Store Retriever node with the Supabase Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Supabase Vector Store node. This is often used with the Question and Answer Chain node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input. An example of the connection flow (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector Store. Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions# Another pattern uses the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to summarize results and answer questions from the Supabase Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Supabase Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store. The connections flow in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector store. Node parameters# Operation Mode# This Vector Store node has five modes: Get Many, Insert Documents, Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool), Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent), and Update Documents. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available. Get Many# In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context. Insert Documents# Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details. Update Documents# Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the ID with the ID of the embedding entry to update. Get Many parameters# Table Name: Enter the Supabase table to use. Prompt: Enter the search query. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Insert Documents parameters# Table Name: Enter the Supabase table to use. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters# Table Name: Enter the Supabase table to use. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters# Name: The name of the vector store. Description: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often. Table Name: Enter the Supabase table to use. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Update Documents# Table Name: Enter the Supabase table to use. ID: The ID of an embedding entry. Node options# Query Name# The name of the matching function you set up in Supabase. If you follow the Supabase quickstart, this will be match_documents. Metadata Filter# Available in Get Many mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document. This is an AND query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match. When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to Default Data Loader for more information on loading documents.

    "content": "Item linking# Programmatic-style nodes only This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically. Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this. This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to Choose your node building approach for more information on node styles. Start by reading Item linking concepts, which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically. If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting pairedItem on each item your node returns: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 // Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item newItem = { \"json\": { . . . }, \"pairedItem\": { \"item\": item.pairedItem, // Optional: choose the input to use // Set this if your node combines multiple inputs \"input\": 0 }; // Or set the index manually newItem = { \"json\": { . . . } \"pairedItem\": { \"item\": i, // Optional: choose the input to use // Set this if your node combines multiple inputs \"input\": 0 }, };"

Node reference# Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name.

For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to Embed on the n8n website. Authentication# You can secure n8n by setting up User management, n8n's built-in authentication feature. n8n supports LDAP and SAML. Credential overwrites# To offer OAuth login to users, it's possible to overwrite credentials on a global basis. This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically. In the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using OAuth by pressing the \"connect\" button on the credentials. n8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API. Using environment variables# You can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA to { CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}. Warning Even though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users. Using REST APIs# The recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT to a path under which this endpoint should be made available. Note The endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons. For example: Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under: 1 export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a oauth-credentials.json file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 { \"asanaOAuth2Api\": { \"clientId\": \"<id>\", \"clientSecret\": \"<secret>\" }, \"githubOAuth2Api\": { \"clientId\": \"<id>\", \"clientSecret\": \"<secret>\" } } Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl: 1 curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials Note There are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the googleSheetsOAuth2Api extends the googleOAuth2Api. In this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (googleOAuth2Api) for all child-credentials (googleSheetsOAuth2Api) to use. Environment variables# n8n has many environment variables you can configure. Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution: Variable Type Default Description EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT Number -1 Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX. Set EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT to -1 to disable. EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE Boolean true Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis. EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE Number 336 The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted. EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT Number 10000 Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit NODES_EXCLUDE Array of strings - Specify which nodes not to load. For example, to block nodes that can be a security risk if users aren't trustworthy: NODES_EXCLUDE: \"[\\\"n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand\\\", \\\"n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile\\\"]\" NODES_INCLUDE Array of strings - Specify which nodes to load. N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED Boolean true Enable workflow templates (true) or disable (false). N8N_TEMPLATES_HOST String https://api.n8n.io Change this if creating your own workflow template library. Note that to use your own workflow templates library, your API must provide the same endpoints and response structure as n8n's. Refer to Workflow templates for more information. Backend hooks# It's possible to define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs.

    "content": "Branch patterns# The relationship between n8n instances and Git branches is flexible. You can create different setups depending on your needs. Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both. Multiple instances, multiple branches# This pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch. You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance. The advantages of this pattern are: An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments. It supports more than two instances. The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments. Multiple instances, one branch# Use this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances. You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production. This pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade. The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance. The disadvantages are: If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you use a GitHub Action to automate pulls to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production. Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction. One instance, multiple branches# The instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a Multiple instances, multiple branches pattern, but with one instance switching between branches. This is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users. No cleanup n8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance. One instance, one branch# This is the simplest pattern."

The path to access the playground depends on your hosting. n8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables: 1 N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs The API version number is 1. There may be multiple versions available in the future. Real data If you select Authorize and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data. The API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the credentials endpoint: 1 N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName} How to find credentialTypeName To find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the {credentialTypeName} is googleDriveOAuth2Api: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { ..., \"credentials\": { \"googleDriveOAuth2Api\": { \"id\": \"9\", \"name\": \"Google Drive\" } } }"

    "content": "Loop Over Items# The Loop Over Items node helps you loop through data when needed. The node saves the original incoming data, and with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data through the loop output. When the node execution completes, it combines all of the processed data and returns it through the done output. When to use the Loop Over Items node# By default, n8n nodes are designed to process a list of input items (with some exceptions, detailed below). Depending on what you're trying to achieve, you often don't need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. You can learn more about how n8n processes multiple items on the looping in n8n page. These links highlight some of the cases where the Loop Over Items node can be useful: Loop until all items are processed: describes how the Loop Over Items node differs from normal item processing and when you might want to incorporate this node. Node exceptions: outlines specific cases and nodes where you may need to use the Loop Over Items node to manually build looping logic. Avoiding rate limiting: demonstrates how to batch API requests to avoid rate limits from other services. Node parameters# Batch Size# Enter the number of items to return with each call. Node options# Reset# If turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop. Use this when you want the Loop Over Items node to treat incoming data as a new set of data instead of a continuation of previous items. For example, you can use the Loop Over Items node with the reset option and an If node to query a paginated service when you don't know how many pages you need in advance. The loop queries pages one at a time, performs any processing, and increments the page number. The loop reset ensures the loop recognizes each iteration as a new set of data. The If node evaluates an exit condition to decide whether to perform another iteration or not. Include a valid termination condition For workflows like the example described above, it's critical to include a valid termination condition for the loop. If your termination condition never matches, your workflow execution will get stuck in an infinite loop. When enabled, you can adjust the reset conditions by switching the parameter representation from Fixed to Expression. The results of your expression evaluation determine when the node will reset item processing.

You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the workflow on n8n.io. The example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to Try it out. The final workflow looks like this: View workflow file Copy the workflow file above and paste into your instance, or manually build it by following these steps: Add the manual trigger.

Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to 1 in the Batch Size field. Add the RSS Feed Read node. Select Test Workflow. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node. Configure RSS Feed Read: map url from the input to the URL field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the INPUT panel, or using this expression: {{ $json.url }}. Select Test Workflow to run the workflow and see the resulting data. Check that the node has processed all items# To check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression: {{$node[\"Loop Over Items\"].context[\"noItemsLeft\"]}}. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns false, otherwise it returns true.

    "content": "Zep Vector Store node# Use the Zep Vector Store to interact with Zep vector databases. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain, or connect it directly to an agent to use as a tool. On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Zep Vector Store node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Examples and templates For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's Zep Vector Store integrations page. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node usage patterns# You can use the Zep Vector Store node in the following patterns. Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents# You can use the Zep Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Zep Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent. You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of this template (the example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same). Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool# You can connect the Zep Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an AI agent to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries. Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Zep Vector Store node. Use a retriever to fetch documents# You can use the Vector Store Retriever node with the Zep Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Zep Vector Store node. This is often used with the Question and Answer Chain node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input. An example of the connection flow (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector Store. Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions# Another pattern uses the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to summarize results and answer questions from the Zep Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Zep Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store. The connections flow (this example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector store. Node parameters# Operation Mode# This Vector Store node has four modes: Get Many, Insert Documents, Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool), and Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent). The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available. Get Many# In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context. Insert Documents# Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)# Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details. Insert Documents parameters# Collection Name: Enter the collection name to store the data in. Get Many parameters# Collection Name: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from. Prompt: Enter the search query. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters# Collection Name: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from. Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters# Name: The name of the vector store. Description: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often. Collection Name: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from. Limit: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to 10 to get the ten best results. Node options# Embedding Dimensions# Must be the same when embedding the data and when querying it. This sets the size of the array of floats used to represent the semantic meaning of a text document. Read more about Zep embeddings in Zep's embeddings documentation. Is Auto Embedded# Available in the Insert Documents Operation Mode, enabled by default. Disable this to configure your embeddings in Zep instead of in n8n. Metadata Filter# Available in Get Many mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document. This is an AND query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match. When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader.

Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing. For a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation."

After this step, your workflow should look like this: View workflow file The next step in Nathan's workflow is to filter the data to only insert the employeeName and orderID of all processing orders into Airtable. For this, you need to use the Edit Fields (Set) node, which allows you to select and set the data you want to transfer from one node to another. Edit Fields node The Edit Fields node can set completely new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases. Disconnect the Airtable node# In your workflow, disconnect the Airtable node from the If node in the same way we disconnected it in the Filtering Orders lesson. Feel free to drag the Airtable node further away if your canvas feels crowded. Configure the Edit Fields node# Now add a new Edit Fields (Set) node by selecting the + icon for the If node's true connector and searching for Edit Fields. With the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters: Ensure Mode is set to Manual Mapping. While you can use the Expression editor we used in the Filtering Orders lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the Input into the Fields to Set: Drag If > orderID as the first field. Drag If > employeeName as the second field. Ensure that Include Other Input Fields is set to false. Select Test step. You should see the following results: Edit Fields (Set) node Add data to Airtable# Next, let's insert these values into Airtable: Go to your Airtable base. Add a new table called processingOrders. Replace the existing columns with two new columns: orderID (primary field): Number employeeName: Single line text Reminder If you get stuck, refer to the Inserting data into Airtable lesson. Delete the three empty rows in the new table. In n8n, connect the Edit Fields node connector to the Airtable node**. Update the Airtable node configuration to point to the new processingOrders table instead of the orders table. Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new processingOrders table. At this stage, your workflow should now look like this: View workflow file What's next?# Nathan 🙋: You've already automated half of my work!

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/",
    "content": "Date and time with Luxon# Luxon is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time. For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to Luxon's documentation. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier. Python support Luxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience variables created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited: You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for $today.minus(...). The generic Luxon functionality, such as Convert date string to Luxon, isn't available for Python users. Variables# n8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables: now: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now(). today: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }). Note that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's DateTime.now(). Expressions (JavaScript) Code node (JavaScript) Code node (Python) 1 2 3 4 5 6 {{$now}} // n8n displays the ISO formatted timestamp // For example 2022-03-09T14:02:37.065+00:00 {{\"Today's date is \" + $now}} // n8n displays \"Today's date is <unix timestamp>\" // For example \"Today's date is 1646834498755\" n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to Data transformation functions | Dates for more information. Date and time behavior in n8n# Be aware of the following: In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes. With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with new Date('2019-06-23'). In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23') or DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\"). Setting the timezone in n8n# Luxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either: Default: America/New York A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable. A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings. Common tasks# This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in Luxon's own documentation. Convert date string to Luxon# You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings. A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with new Date('2019-06-23'). In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23') or DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\"). If you have a date in a supported standard technical format:# Most dates use fromISO(). This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example: Expressions (JavaScript) Code node (JavaScript) 1 {{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}} Luxon's API documentation has more information on fromISO. Luxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to Parsing technical formats for details. If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:# Use Luxon's Ad-hoc parsing. To do this, use the fromFormat() function, providing the string and a set of tokens that describe the format. For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as 23-06-2019. You want to turn this into a Luxon object: Expressions (JavaScript) Code node (JavaScript) 1 {{DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")}} When using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about Limitations. If you see unexpected results, try their Debugging guide. Get n days from today# Get a number of days before or after today. Expressions (JavaScript) Code node (JavaScript) For example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date. In the expressions editor, enter: 1 {{$today.minus({days: 7})}} On the 23rd June 2019, this returns [Object: \"2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00\"]. This example uses n8n's custom variable $today for convenience. It's the equivalent of DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7}). For more detailed information and examples, refer to: Luxon's guide to math Their API documentation on DateTime plus and DateTime minus Create human-readable dates# In Get n days from today, the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as [Object: \"yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00\"] (for expressions) or yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00 (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions. For example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns 23/06/2019. This expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format. Expressions (JavaScript) Code node (JavaScript) 1 {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}} You can alter the format. For example: Expressions (JavaScript) Code node (JavaScript) 1 {{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}} On 23rd June 2019, this returns \"16 June 2019\". Refer to Luxon's guide on toLocaleString (strings for humans) for more information. Get the time between two dates# To get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration. For example, get the number of months between two dates: Expressions (JavaScript) Code node (JavaScript) 1 {{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}} This returns [Object: {\"months\":1}]. Refer to Luxon's Diffs for more information. A longer example: How many days to Christmas?# This example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation. The scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year. Expressions (JavaScript) Code node (JavaScript) 1 {{\"There are \" + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + \" days to Christmas!\"}} This outputs \"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!\". For example, on 9th March, it outputs \"There are 291 days to Christmas!\". A detailed explanation of what the expression does: {{: indicates the start of the expression. \"There are \": a string. +: used to join two strings. $today.diff(): This is similar to the example in Get the time between two dates, but it uses n8n's custom $today variable. DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days': this part gets the current year using $today.year, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days. toObject() turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns [Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}]. For example, on 9th March, [Object: {\"days\":-291}]. .days uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our JMESpath documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number. .toString().substring(1) turns the number into a string and removes the -. + \" days to Christmas!\": another string, with a + to join it to the previous string. }}: indicates the end of the expression."

Lowercase Headers# Choose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off). Redirects# Choose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in Max Redirects. Response# Use this option to set some details about the expected API response, including: Include Response Headers and Status: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body. Never Error: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned. Response Format: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from: Autodetect (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned. File: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in Put Output in Field. JSON: Select this option to format the response as JSON. Text: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in Put Output in Field. Pagination# Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call. Inspect the API data first Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns. Understand pagination Configure the pagination settings: Pagination Mode: Off: Turn off pagination. Update a Parameter in Each Request: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request. Response Contains Next URL: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set Next URL. For example setups, refer to HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination. n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination: Variable Description $pageCount The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched. $request The request object sent by the HTTP node. $response The response object from the HTTP call. Includes $response.body, $response.headers, and $response.statusCode. The contents of body and headers depend on the data sent by the API. API differences Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like: Does the API provide the URL for the next page? Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number? The structure of the data that the API returns. Proxy# Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy. Enter the Proxy the request should use. Timeout# Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response. Enter the Timeout time to wait in milliseconds. Import curl command# curl is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node. Import a curl command: From the HTTP Request node's Parameters tab, select Import cURL. The Import cURL command modal opens. Paste your curl command into the text box. Select Import. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.

    "content": "Choose your node building approach# n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic. You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style: Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs. Is more future-proof. Supports integration with REST APIs. The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for: Trigger nodes Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies. Any node that needs to transform incoming data. Full versioning. Refer to Node versioning for more information on types of versioning. Data handling differences# The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an execute() method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the routing key in the operations object. Refer to Node base file for more information on node parameters and the execute() method. Syntax differences# To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called \"FriendGrid.\" The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/",
    "content": "Docker Installation# Docker offers the following advantages: Installs n8n in a clean environment. Easier setup for your preferred database. Can avoid issues due to different operating systems, as Docker provides a consistent system. Can avoid compatibility issues due to differences in operating systems and tools. Makes migrating to new hosts or environments more straightforward. You can also use n8n in Docker with Docker Compose. You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the n8n-hosting repository. Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including: Setting up and configuring servers and containers Managing application resources and scaling Securing servers and applications Configuring n8n n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends n8n Cloud. Prerequisites# Before proceeding, install Docker Desktop. Linux Users Docker Desktop is available for Mac and Windows. Linux users must install Docker Engine and Docker Compose individually for your distribution. Latest and Next versions n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The latest version is for production use. next is the most recent release. You should treat next as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the forum. Current latest: 1.86.1 Current next: 1.88.0 Starting n8n# From your terminal, run: 1 2 3 docker volume create n8n_data docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n This command creates a volume to store persistent data, downloads the required n8n image, and starts your container, exposed on port 5678. To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, n8n_data, to persist your data locally. Once running, you can access n8n by opening: http://localhost:5678 Using with PostgreSQL# By default, n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions, and workflows. n8n also supports PostgreSQL, configurable using environment variables as detailed below. When using PostgreSQL, it's still important to persist the data stored in the /home/node/.n8n folder. This includes n8n user data and, even more importantly, the encryption key for credentials. It's also the name of the webhook when using the n8n tunnel. If n8n can't find the /home/node/.n8n directory on startup, it automatically creates one. In this case, all existing credentials that n8n saved with a different encryption key will no longer work. Keep in mind While persisting the /home/node/.n8n directory with PostgreSQL is the recommended best practice, it's not explicitly required. You can provide the encryption key by passing the N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable when starting your Docker container. To use n8n with PostgreSQL, execute the following commands, replacing the placeholders (depicted within angled brackets, for example <POSTGRES_USER>) with your actual values: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 docker volume create n8n_data docker run -it --rm \\ --name n8n \\ -p 5678:5678 \\ -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \\ -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \\ -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \\ -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \\ -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \\ -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \\ -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \\ -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\ docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n You can find a complete docker-compose file for PostgreSQL in the n8n hosting repository. Setting timezone# To define the timezone n8n should use, you can set the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable. Schedule-oriented nodes, like the Schedule Trigger node use this to determine the correct timezone. You can set the system timezone, which controls what some scripts and commands like date return, using the TZ environment variable. This example sets the same timezone for both variables: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 docker volume create n8n_data docker run -it --rm \\ --name n8n \\ -p 5678:5678 \\ -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE=\"Europe/Berlin\" \\ -e TZ=\"Europe/Berlin\" \\ -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\ docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n Updating# To update n8n, in Docker Desktop, navigate to the Images tab and select Pull from the context menu to download the latest n8n image: You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Pull latest (stable) version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n # Pull specific version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:1.81.0 # Pull next (unstable) version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next After pulling the updated image, stop your n8n container and start it again. You can also use the command line. Replace <container_id> in the commands below with the container ID you find in the first command: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 # Find your container ID docker ps -a # Stop the container with the `<container_id>` docker stop <container_id> # Remove the container with the `<container_id>` docker rm <container_id> # Start the container docker run --name=<container_name> [options] -d docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n Updating Docker Compose# If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Pull latest version docker compose pull # Stop and remove older version docker compose down # Start the container docker compose up -d Further reading# You can find more information about Docker setup in the README file for the Docker image. n8n with tunnel# Danger Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production. To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a tunnel service that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance. Start n8n with --tunnel by running: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 docker volume create n8n_data docker run -it --rm \\ --name n8n \\ -p 5678:5678 \\ -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\ docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \\ start --tunnel Next steps# Learn more about configuring and scaling n8n.

Internal error: 400 Invalid value for 'content'# A full error message might look like this: 1 2 3 Internal error Error: 400 Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null. <stack-trace> This error can occur if the Prompt input contains a null value. You might see this in one of two scenarios: When you've set the Prompt to Define below and have an expression in your Text that isn't generating a value. To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null. When you've set the Prompt to Connected Chat Trigger Node and the incoming data has null values. To resolve, remove any null values from the chatInput field of the input node. Error in sub-node Simple Memory# This error displays when n8n runs into an issue with the Simple Memory sub-node. It most often occurs when your workflow or the workflow template you copied uses an older version of the Simple memory node (previously known as \"Window Buffer Memory\"). Try removing the Simple Memory node from your workflow and re-adding it, which will guarantee you're using the latest version of the node. A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error# This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Chat Model connected. To resolve this, click the + Chat Model button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Chat Model + connector when the node is closed. n8n will then open a selection of possible Chat Models to pick from. No prompt specified error# This error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the Chat Trigger Node. To resolve this issue, find the Prompt parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from Connected Chat Trigger Node to Define below. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text."

    "content": "Glossary AI agent# AI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available. AI chain# AI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this). AI embedding# Embeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings. AI memory# In an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't. AI tool# In an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks. AI vector store# Vector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings. API# APIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI. canvas (n8n)# The canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows. cluster node (n8n)# In n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality. credential (n8n)# In n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service. data pinning (n8n)# Data pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution. editor (n8n)# The n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more. entitlement (n8n)# In n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time. Floating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance. evaluation (n8n)# In n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows. expression (n8n)# In n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment. LangChain# LangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications. Large language model (LLM)# Large language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data. node (n8n)# In n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services. project (n8n)# n8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources. root node (n8n)# Each n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality. sub node (n8n)# n8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example. template (n8n)# n8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs. trigger node (n8n)# A trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run. workflow (n8n)# An n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks."

Using this with the AI option can help improve the output of the agent. Using both together provides a sample of an input and expected response (the AI Message) for the model to follow. Select one of these input types: Text: Enter a sample user input as a text Message. Image (Binary): Select a binary input from a previous node. Enter the Image Data Field Name to identify which binary field from the previous node contains the image data. Image (URL): Use this option to feed an image in from a URL. Enter the Image URL. For both the Image types, select the Image Details to control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. Choose from: Auto: The model uses the auto setting, which looks at the image input size and decide if it should use the Low or High setting. Low: The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens. Use this option for use cases that don't require high detail. High: The model can access the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens. Use this option for use cases that require high detail.

Processing and manipulating data. n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to: Built-in integrations to browse the node library. Community nodes for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes. Creating nodes to start building your own nodes. Add a node to your workflow# Add a node to an empty workflow# Select Add first step. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse trigger nodes. Select the trigger you want to use. Choose the correct app event If you select On App Event, n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list. For example, this is the trigger for Asana: Add a node to an existing workflow# Select the Add node connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes. Node operations: Triggers and Actions# When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data. There are two types of operation: Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon . Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected. Node controls# To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas: Test step : Run the node. Deactivate : Deactivate the node. Delete : Delete the node. Node context menu : Select node actions. Available actions: Open node Test step Rename node Deactivate node Pin node Copy node Duplicate node Select all Clear selection Delete node Node settings# The node settings under the Settings tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes. When active or set, they do the following: Request Options: Select Add Option to view and select these options. Batching: Control how to batch large numbers of input items. Ignore SSL Issues: Download the response even if SSL validation isn't possible. Proxy: Use this if you need to specify an HTTP proxy. Timeout: Set a timeout for the request in ms. Always Output Data: The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop. Execute Once: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items. Retry On Fail: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds. On Error: Stop Workflow: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution. Continue: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data. Continue (using error output): Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling. You can document your workflow using node notes: Notes: Note to save with the node. Display note in flow: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle."

You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item.

To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control. New to Git and source control? If you're new to Git, don't panic. You don't need to learn Git to use n8n. This document explains the concepts you need. You do need some Git knowledge to set up the source control, as this involves work in your Git provider. Familiar with Git and source control? If you're familiar with Git, don't rely on behaviors matching exactly. In particular, be aware that source control in n8n doesn't support a pull request-style review and merge process, unless you do this outside n8n in your Git provider. This page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the Setup should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider. This is a brief introduction Git is a complex topic. This section provides a brief introduction to the key terms you need when using environments in n8n. If you want to learn about Git in depth, refer to GitHub | Git and GitHub learning resources. Git overview# Git is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. Branches: Multiple copies of a project# Git uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch. Local and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider# A common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine. n8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them. Push, pull, and commit# n8n uses three key Git processes: Push: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save. Pull: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. You will need to populate any credentials or variable stubs included in the refreshed items. Pulling overwrites your work If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git. Commit: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time. Refer to Push and pull for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git."

Activating a workflow means that it will run automatically every time a trigger node receives input or meets a condition. By default, all newly created workflows start deactivated. To activate your workflow, set the Inactive toggle in the top navigation of the Editor UI to be Activated. Nathan's workflow will now be executed automatically every Monday at 9 AM: Activated workflow Workflow Executions# An execution represents a completed run of a workflow, from the first to the last node. n8n logs workflow executions, allowing you to see if the workflow succeeded or not. The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues. To view the executions for a specific workflow, you can switch to the Executions tab when the workflow is open on the canvas. Use the Editor tab to swap back to the node editor. To see the execution log for the entire n8n instance, in your Editor UI, select Overview and then select the Executions tab in the main panel. Execution List The Executions window displays a table with the following information: Name: The name of the workflow Started At: The date and time when the workflow started Status: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute Execution ID: The ID of this workflow execution Workflow execution status You can filter the displayed Executions by workflow and by status (Any Status, Failed, Cancelled, Running, Success, or Waiting). The information displayed here depends on which executions you configure to save in the Workflow Settings. Workflow Settings# You can customize your workflows and executions, or overwrite some global default settings in Workflow Settings. Access these settings by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner of the Editor UI when the workflow is open on the canvas, then select Settings. Workflow Settings In the Workflow Settings window you can configure the following settings: Execution Order: Choose the execution logic for multi-branch workflows. You should leave this set to v1 if you don't have workflows that rely on the legacy execution ordering. Error Workflow: A workflow to run if the execution of the current workflow fails. This workflow can be called by: Workflows allowed to call this workflow using the Execute Sub-workflow node. Timezone: The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone. In particular, this setting is important for the Schedule Trigger node, as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time. Save failed production executions: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it fails. Default is to save. Save successful production executions: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it succeeds. Default is to save. Save manual executions: If n8n should save executions started from the Editor UI. Default is to save. Save execution progress: If n8n should save the execution data of each node. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is to not save. Timeout Workflow: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is to not timeout. What's next?# You 👩‍🔧: That was it! Now you have a 7-node workflow that will run automatically every Monday morning. You don't have to worry about remembering to wrangle the data.

Set up OAuth# There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services: Create a Google Cloud Console project. Enable APIs. Configure your OAuth consent screen. Create your Google OAuth client credentials. Finish your n8n credential. Create a Google Cloud Console project# First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section: Log in to the Google Cloud Console using your Google credentials. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select New project or go directly to the New Project page. Enter a Project name and select the Location for your project. Select Create. Check the top navigation and make sure the Select a project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created. Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation Enable APIs# With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to: Access your Google Cloud Console - Library. Make sure you're in the correct project. Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation Go to APIs & Services > Library. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access: Google Perspective: Request API Access. Google Ads: Get a Developer Token. Google Drive API required The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API: Google Docs Google Sheets Google Slides Google Vertex AI API In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the Cloud Resource Manager API. Select ENABLE. Configure your OAuth consent screen# If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to configure the OAuth consent screen: Access your Google Cloud Console - Library. Make sure you're in the correct project. Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation Open the left navigation menu and go to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen. For User Type, select Internal for user access within your organization's Google workspace or External for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's User type documentation for more information on user types. Select Create. Enter the essential information: App name User support email Email addresses field in Developer contact information In the Authorized domains section, add n8n.cloud if using n8n's Cloud service. If you're self-hosting, add the domain of your n8n instance. Select SAVE AND CONTINUE to go to the Scopes page. You don't need to set any scopes. Select SAVE AND CONTINUE again to go to the Summary page. On the Summary page, review the information for accuracy. Create your Google OAuth client credentials# Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google: In the APIs & Services section, select Credentials. Select + CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID. In the Application type dropdown, select Web application. Google automatically generates a Name. Update the Name to something you'll recognize in your console. From your n8n credential, copy the OAuth Redirect URL. Paste it into the Authorized redirect URIs in Google Console. Select CREATE. Finish your n8n credential# With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential: From Google's OAuth client created modal, copy the Client ID. Enter this in your n8n credential. From the same Google modal, copy the Client Secret. Enter this in your n8n credential. You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to Scopes for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example: 1 https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose In n8n, select Sign in with Google to complete your Google authentication. Save your new credentials. Video# The following video demonstrates the steps described above: Scopes# Google services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs for a list of scopes for all services. n8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the Supported scopes list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work. Supported scopes Troubleshooting# Google hasn't verified this app# If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning Google hasn't verified this app. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate. If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app. Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized# For Google Cloud apps with Publishing status set to Testing and User type set to External, consent and tokens expire after seven days.

How environments work in n8n. Environments: What and why# In software development, the environment is all the infrastructure and tooling around the code, including the tools that run the software, and the specific configuration of those tools. For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to Codecademy | Environments. Low-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive configuration options. You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in. There are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production: Development: do work and make changes. Production: the live environment. A setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use. Environments in n8n# In n8n, an environment comprises two parts, an n8n instance and a Git branch: The n8n instance is where you build and run workflows. The Git branch stores copies of the workflows, as well as tags, and variable and credential stubs. n8n doesn't sync credentials and variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials and variable values manually when setting up a new instance. For more information, refer to Push and pull | What gets committed and Manage variables. How you copy work between environments depends on your branch and n8n instance configuration: Multiple instances, one branch: you can push from one instance to the Git branch, then pull the work to another instance. Multiple instances, multiple branches: you need to create a pull request and merge in your Git provider. For example, if you have development, test, and production branches, each linked to their own instance, you need to merge the development branch into test to make the work from the development instance available on the test instance. Refer to Copy work between environments for more information, including steps to partially automate the process. For detailed guidance on pushing and pulling work, refer to Push and pull. Refer to Set up source control to learn more about linking your n8n instance to Git, or follow the Tutorial: Create environments with source control to set up your environments using one of n8n's recommended configurations."

Node operations: Triggers and Actions# When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data. There are two types of operation: Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon . Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected. Core nodes# Core nodes can be actions or triggers. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Cluster nodes# Cluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node. Credentials# External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as credentials. Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials. To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under ~/.n8n/config. To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to Manage credentials. Community nodes# n8n supports custom nodes built by the community.

You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain or connect it directly to an agent to use as a tool. On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Qdrant node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node usage patterns# You can use the Qdrant Vector Store node in the following patterns. Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents# You can use the Qdrant Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Qdrant Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent. You can see an example of this in the first part of this template. Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool# You can connect the Qdrant Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an AI agent to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries. Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Qdrant Vector Store node. Use a retriever to fetch documents# You can use the Vector Store Retriever node with the Qdrant Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Qdrant Vector Store node. This is often used with the Question and Answer Chain node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input. An example of the connection flow would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector Store. Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions# Another pattern uses the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to summarize results and answer questions from the Qdrant Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Qdrant Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store. The connections flow in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector store. Node parameters# Operation Mode# This Vector Store node has four modes: Get Many, Insert Documents, Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool), and Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent). The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available. Get Many# In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context. Insert Documents# Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

Or: Using the Create button in the upper-right corner from either the Overview page or a specific project. Select Credential. If you're doing this from the Overview page, you'll create the credential inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the credential inside that specific project. Select the app or service you wish to connect to. You can also create new credential in the credential drop down when editing a node on the workflow editor. Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the credentials library for guidance. When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works. Credentials naming n8n names new credentials \"node name account\" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials. Expressions in credentials# You can use expressions to set credentials dynamically as your workflow runs: In your workflow, find the data path containing the credential. This varies depending on the exact parameter names in your data. Make sure that the data containing the credential is available in the workflow when you get to the node that needs it. When creating your credential, hover over the field where you want to use an expression. Toggle Expression on. Enter your expression. Example workflow# View workflow file Using the example# To load the template into your n8n instance: Download the workflow JSON file. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.

All platforms# n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner. Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes. To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history. Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value: The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated. Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.

The language model uses the Sentiment Categories in the node options to determine each item's sentiment. Node parameters# Text to Analyze defines the input text for sentiment analysis. This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be {{ $json.chatInput }} if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a text field. Node options# Sentiment Categories: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as. By default, these are Positive, Neutral, Negative. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative for more granular analysis. Include Detailed Results: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements. System Prompt Template: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the {categories} placeholder for the categories. Enable Auto-Fixing: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it. Usage Notes# Model Temperature Setting# It's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs. Language Considerations# The node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text. For best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language. Processing Large Volumes# When analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage. Iterative Refinement# For complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results. Example Usage# Basic Sentiment Analysis# Connect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node. Set the \"Text to Analyze\" field to the relevant item property (for example, {{ $json.content }} for blog post content). Keep the default sentiment categories. Connect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently. Custom Category Analysis# Change the Sentiment Categories to Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry. Adjust your workflow to handle these five output categories. Use this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories. Related resources# View n8n's Advanced AI documentation.

    "content": "Understanding the data structure# In this chapter, you will learn about the data structure of n8n and how to use the Code node to transform data and simulate node outputs. Data structure of n8n# In a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be. The data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects. About array of objects An array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array [\"Leonardo\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Donatello\", \"Raphael\"]; the element Donatello is stored at index 2. An object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (name and color): 1 2 3 4 { name: 'Michelangelo', color: 'blue', } An array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array turtles below contains four objects: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 var turtles = [ { name: 'Michelangelo', color: 'orange', }, { name: 'Donatello', color: 'purple', }, { name: 'Raphael', color: 'red', }, { name: 'Leonardo', color: 'blue', } ]; You can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax object.property. For example, turtles[1].color gets the color of the second turtle. Data sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items. Items An n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data. Items in the Customer Datastore node Creating data sets with the Code node# Now that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the Code node to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 return [ { json: { apple: 'beets', } } ]; For example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node: Array of objects in the Code node JSON objects Notice that this array of objects contains an extra key: json. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key json. Illustration of data structure in n8n It's good practice to pass the data in the right structure used by n8n. But don't worry if you forget to add the json key to an item, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) adds it automatically. You can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces {}. n8n data structure video This talk offers a more detailed explanation of data structure in n8n. Exercise# In a Code node, create an array of objects named myContacts that contains the properties name and email, and the email property is further split into personal and work. Show me the solution Referencing node data with the Code node# Just like you can use expressions to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some methods and variables in the Code node. Please make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise. Exercise# Let's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named workEmail that references the work email of the first contact. Show me the solution Transforming data# The incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to transform the data, so that each item can be processed individually. The two most common operations for data transformation are: Creating multiple items from one item Creating a single item from multiple items There are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above: Use n8n's data transformation nodes. Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the Code node: Use the Split Out node to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items. Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items. Use the Code node to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the Run Once for All Items mode: To create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named data set to an array of items in the form of: [{ \"data\": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]: 1 2 3 4 5 return $input.first().json.data.map(item => { return { json: item } }); To create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 return [ { json: { data_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json) } } ]; These JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 let items = $input.all(); return items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => { return { json: item } }); Exercise# Use the HTTP Request node to make a GET request to the PokéAPI https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon. (This API requires no authentication). Transform the data in the results field with the Split Out node. Transform the data in the results field with the Code node. Show me the solution"

    "content": "Cloud concurrency# Only for n8n Cloud This document discusses concurrency in n8n Cloud. Read self-hosted n8n concurrency control to learn how concurrency works with self-hosted n8n instances. Too many concurrent executions can cause performance degradation and unresponsiveness. To prevent this and improve instance stability, n8n sets concurrency limits for production executions in regular mode. Any executions beyond the limits queue for later processing. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order. Concurrency limits# n8n limits the number of concurrent executions for Cloud instances according to their plan: Starter and Trial: 5 Pro (10k workflow executions, 15 active workflows): 20 Pro (50k workflow executions, 50 active workflows): 50 Enterprise (in regular mode): 200 You can view the number of active executions and your plan's concurrency limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab. Details# Some other details about concurrency to keep in mind: Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, or error executions. Test evaluations do not count towards concurrency limits. Your test evaluation concurrency limit is equal to, but separate from, your plan's regular concurrency limit. You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue. On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest. Comparison to queue mode# Feature availability Queue mode is available for Cloud Enterprise plans. To enable it, contact n8n. Concurrency in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency in regular mode. In queue mode, the concurrency settings determine how many jobs each worker can run in parallel. In regular mode, concurrency limits apply to the entire instance."

    "content": "Memory-related errors# n8n doesn't restrict the amount of data each node can fetch and process. While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors. Only for self-hosted n8n This page describes memory-related errors when self-hosting n8n. Visit Cloud data management to learn about memory limits for n8n Cloud. Identifying out of memory situations# n8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it). Error messages including Problem running workflow, Connection Lost, or 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable. When self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory in your server logs. On n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually. Typical causes# Such problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include: Amount of JSON data. Size of binary data. Number of nodes in a workflow. Some nodes are memory-heavy: the Code node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly. Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend. Additional workflows running at the same time. Avoiding out of memory situations# When encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption. Increase available memory# When self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider. On n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan. Reduce memory consumption# This approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows. Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution. Avoid using the Code node where possible. Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data. Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow. Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the Loop Over Items node to split up the items into smaller batches and the Execute Workflow node to start the sub-workflow. However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again. Increase old memory# This applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering JavaScript heap out of memory errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate V8 option --max-old-space-size=SIZE either through the CLI or through the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable."

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/common-issues/",
    "content": "Notion node common issues# Here are some common errors and issues with the Notion node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Relation property not displaying# The Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for two-way relations. When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's Database Page resource. To enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the Show on [name of related database] option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting. If you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the HTTP Request with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a PATCH request to the following URL: 1 https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id> Enable Send Body, set the Body Content Type to JSON, and set Specify Body to Using JSON. Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the JSON field: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 { \"properties\": { \"Account\": { \"relation\": [ { \"id\": \"<your_relation_ID>\" } ] } } } Create toggle heading# The Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to Page, Database Page, or Block resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself. You can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the is_toggleable property: Add a heading with Notion node. Select the resource you want to add a heading to: To add a new page with a heading, select the Page or Database Page resources with the Create operation. To add a heading to an existing page, select the Block resource with the Append After operation. Select Add Block and set the Type Name or ID to either Heading 1, Heading 2, or Heading 3. Add an HTTP Request node connected to the Notion node and select the GET method. Set the URL to https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first. Select Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials. Add an Edit Fields (Set) node after the HTTP Request node. Add heading_1.is_toggleable as a new Boolean field set to true. Swap heading_1 for a different heading number as necessary. Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node. Set the Method to PATCH and use https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }} as the URL value. Select Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials. Enable Send Body and set a parameter. Set the parameter Name to heading_1 (substitute heading_1 for the heading level you are using). Set the parameter Value to {{ $json.heading_1 }} (substitute heading_1 for the heading level you are using). The above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the is_toggleable property, and update the heading block. Handle null and empty values# You may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing. To work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value. To check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an If node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the Edit Fields (Set) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value. As an alternative, you can set a default value if the incoming data doesn't provide one."

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/",
    "content": "Queue mode# You can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability. Binary data storage n8n doesn't support queue mode with binary data storage in filesystem. If your workflows need to persist binary data in queue mode, you can use S3 external storage. How it works# When running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions. Each worker is its own Node.js instance, running in main mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second). By using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload. This is the process flow: The main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution. It passes the execution ID to a message broker, Redis, which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up. A worker in the pool picks up message from Redis. The worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database. After completing the workflow execution, the worker: Writes the results to the database. Posts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished. Redis notifies the main instance. Configuring workers# Workers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete. Set encryption key# n8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using environment variable if desired. The encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database. Set the encryption key for each worker node in a configuration file or by setting the corresponding environment variable: 1 export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key> Set executions mode# Database considerations n8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to queue with an SQLite database isn't recommended. Set the environment variable EXECUTIONS_MODE to queue on the main instance and any workers using the following command. 1 export EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue Alternatively, you can set executions.mode to queue in the configuration file. Start Redis# Running Redis on a separate machine You can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it's accessible by the n8n instance. To run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below: Run the following command to start a Redis instance: 1 docker run --name some-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis By default, Redis runs on localhost on port 6379 with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis. Using configuration file Using environment variables Description queue.bull.redis.host:localhost QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost By default, Redis runs on localhost. queue.bull.redis.port:6379 QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379 The default port is 6379. If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value. You can also set the following optional configurations: Using configuration file Using environment variables Description queue.bull.redis.username:USERNAME QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_USERNAME By default, Redis doesn't require a username. If you're using a specific user, configure it variable. queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD By default, Redis doesn't require a password. If you're using a password, configure it variable. queue.bull.redis.db:0 QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB The default value is 0. If you change this value, update the configuration. queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is 10000 (ms). queue.bull.gracefulShutdownTimeout:30 N8N_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT A graceful shutdown timeout for workers to finish executing jobs before terminating the process. The default value is 30 seconds. Now you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance. Start workers# You will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database. Start worker processes by running the following command from the root directory: 1 ./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker If you're using Docker, use the following command: 1 docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n worker You can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database. Worker server# Each worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints: /healthz: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE environment variable /healthz/readiness: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE environment variable credentials overwrite endpoint /metrics View running workers# Feature availability Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans. If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, contact n8n. You can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting Settings > Workers. Running n8n with queues# When running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. This means that even the webhook calls get delegated to the worker processes, which might add some overhead and extra latency. Redis acts as the message broker, and the database persists data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite isn't supported. Migrate data If you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the CLI commands for n8n documentation to learn how to use these commands. Webhook processors# Keep in mind Webhook processes rely on Redis and need the EXECUTIONS_MODE environment variable set too. Follow the configure the workers section above to setup webhook processor nodes. Webhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests. This method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: 5678). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly. n8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI. You can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory: 1 ./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook If you're using Docker, use the following command: 1 docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 -e \"EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue\" docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n webhook Configure webhook URL# To configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance: 1 export WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com You can also set this value in the configuration file. Configure load balancer# When using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows: Redirect any request that matches /webhook/* to the webhook servers pool All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process Note: The default URL for manual workflow executions is /webhook-test/*. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process. You can change this path in the configuration file endpoints.webhook or using the N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly. Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional)# You have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess to true so that n8n doesn't process webhook requests on the main process. Alternatively, you can use the following command: 1 export N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS=true When disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool. Configure worker concurrency# You can define the number of jobs a worker can run in parallel by using the concurrency flag. It defaults to 10. To change it: 1 n8n worker --concurrency=5 Concurrency and scaling recommendations# n8n recommends setting concurrency to 5 or higher for your worker instances. Setting low concurrency values with a large numbers of workers can exhaust your database's connection pool, leading to processing delays and failures. Multi-main setup# Feature availability Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans. If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, contact n8n. In queue mode you can run more than one main process for high availability. In a single-mode setup, the main process does two sets of tasks: regular tasks, such as running the API, serving the UI, and listening for webhooks, and at-most-once tasks, such as running non-HTTP triggers (timers, pollers, and persistent connections like RabbitMQ and IMAP), and pruning executions and binary data. In a multi-main setup, there are two kinds of main processes: followers, which run regular tasks, and the leader, which runs both regular and at-most-once tasks. Leader designation# In a multi-main setup, all main instances handle the leadership process transparently to users. In case the current leader becomes unavailable, for example because it crashed or its event loop became too busy, other followers can take over. If the previous leader becomes responsive again, it becomes a follower. Configuring multi-main setup# To deploy n8n in multi-main setup, ensure: All main processes are running in queue mode and are connected to Postgres and Redis. All main and worker processes are running the same version of n8n. All main processes have set the environment variable N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_ENABLED to true. All main processes are running behind a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) enabled. If needed, you can adjust the leader key options: Using configuration file Using environment variables Description multiMainSetup.ttl:10 N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_KEY_TTL=10 Time to live (in seconds) for leader key in multi-main setup. multiMainSetup.interval:3 N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_CHECK_INTERVAL=3 Interval (in seconds) for leader check in multi-main setup."

Enable domain-wide delegation# To impersonate a user with a service account, you must enable domain-wide delegation for the service account. Not recommended Google recommends you avoid using domain-wide delegation, as it allows impersonation of any user (including super admins) and can pose a security risk. To delegate domain-wide authority to a service account, you must be a super administrator for the Google Workspace domain. Then: From your Google Workspace domain's Admin console, select the hamburger menu, then select Security > Access and data control > API Controls. In the Domain wide delegation pane, select Manage Domain Wide Delegation. Select Add new. In the Client ID field, enter the service account's Client ID. To get the Client ID: Open your Google Cloud Console project, then open the Service Accounts page. Copy the OAuth 2 Client ID and use this as the Client ID for the Domain Wide Delegation. In the OAuth scopes field, enter a list of comma-separate scopes to grant your application access. For example, if your application needs domain-wide full access to the Google Drive API and the Google Calendar API, enter: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Workflow Tool node, and links to more resources. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node parameters# Name# Enter a name for your custom code. It can't contain whitespace or special characters. Description# Enter a custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example: Call this tool to get a random color.

Parameter and copy in a complete workflow JSON. Workflow Values# Set values to pass to the workflow you're calling. These values appear in the output data of the trigger node in the workflow you call. You can access these values in expressions in the workflow.

    "content": "Task runners# Task runners are a generic mechanism to execute tasks in a secure and performant way. They're used to execute user-provided JavaScript code in the Code node. This document describes how task runners work and how you can configure them. How it works# The task runner feature consists of three components: a task runner, a task broker, and a task requester. Task runners connect to the task broker using a websocket connection. A task requester submits a task request to the broker where an available task runner can pick it up for execution. The runner executes the task and submits the results to the task requester. The task broker coordinates communication between the runner and the requester. The n8n instance (main and worker) acts as the broker. The Code node in this case is the task requester. Task runner modes# You can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external. Internal mode# In internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same uid and gid as n8n. External mode# In external mode, an external orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes) launches the task runner instead of n8n. Typically, this means you would configure the task runner to run as a side-car container next to n8n. In this mode, the orchestrator monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner container. The task runner is fully isolated from the n8n instance. When using the Queue mode, each n8n container (main and workers) needs to have its own task runner. Setting up external mode# Use the following details to configure task runners in external mode Configuring n8n instance in external mode# You can configure n8n to use external task runners by setting the following environment variables: Environment variables Description N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true Enables task runners. N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external Use task runners in external mode. N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret> A shared secret task runners use to connect to the broker. N8N_RUNNERS_BROKER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 By default, the task broker only listens to localhost. When using multiple containers (for example, with Docker Compose), it needs to be able to accept external connections. For full list of environment variables see task runner environment variables. Configuring task runners in external mode# The task runner comes bundled within the n8n Docker image. The Docker image also includes the task runner launcher. The launcher can start the runner on-demand, which means lower memory usage when there's no work needed, but a short delay (few hundred ms) in cold-start. The launcher also monitors the runner and restarts it in case of infinite loops or other issues. Run a task runner container from the n8n Docker image by setting the following properties: Configuration Description command [\"/usr/local/bin/task-runner-launcher\", \"javascript\"] livenessProbe GET /healthz, port 5680 Set the following environment variables for the container, adjusted to fit your needs: Environment variables Description N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret> The shared secret the task runner uses to connect to the broker. N8N_RUNNERS_MAX_CONCURRENCY=5 The number of concurrent tasks the runner can execute. N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=localhost:5679 The address of the task broker server within the n8n instance. N8N_RUNNERS_AUTO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=15 Number of seconds of inactivity to wait before shutting down the task runner process. The launcher will automatically start the runner again when there are new tasks to execute. Set to 0 to disable automatic shutdown. NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=<limit> The memory limit for the task runner Node.js process. This should be lower than the limit for container so that the runner runs out of memory before the container. That way, the launcher is able to monitor the runner. GENERIC_TIMEZONE The same default timezone as configured for the n8n instance. For full list of environment variables see task runner environment variables."

    "content": "Self-hosted concurrency control# Only for self-hosted n8n This document is for self-hosted concurrency control. Read Cloud concurrency to learn how concurrency works with n8n Cloud accounts. In regular mode, n8n doesn't limit how many production executions may run at the same time. This can lead to a scenario where too many concurrent executions thrash the event loop, causing performance degradation and unresponsiveness. To prevent this, you can set a concurrency limit for production executions in regular mode. Use this to control how many production executions run concurrently, and queue up any concurrent production executions over the limit. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order. Concurrency control is disabled by default. To enable it: 1 export N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT=20 Keep in mind: Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, error executions, or started from CLI. You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue. On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest. To monitor concurrency control, watch logs for executions being added to the queue and released. In a future version, n8n will show concurrency control in the UI. When you enable concurrency control, you can view the number of active executions and the configured limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab. Comparison to queue mode# In queue mode, you can control how many jobs a worker may run concurrently using the --concurrency flag. Concurrency control in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency control in regular mode, but the environment variable N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT controls both of them. In queue mode, n8n takes the limit from this variable if set to a value other than -1, falling back to the --concurrency flag or its default."

    "content": "Query JSON with JMESPath# JMESPath is a query language for JSON that you can use to extract and transform elements from a JSON document. For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the JMESPath documentation. The jmespath() method# n8n provides a custom method, jmespath(). Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language. The basic syntax is: JavaScript Python 1 $jmespath(object, searchString) To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript: 1 2 var jmespath = require('jmespath'); jmespath.search(object, searchString); Expressions must be single-line The longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line. object is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. searchString is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The JMESPath Specification provides a list of supported expressions, while their Tutorial and Examples provide interactive examples. Search parameter order The examples in the JMESPath Specification follow the pattern search(searchString, object). The JMESPath JavaScript library, which n8n uses, supports search(object, searchString) instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters. Common tasks# This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in JMESPath's own documentation. When trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node Mode to Run Once for Each Item. Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections# From the JMESPath projections documentation: Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections: List Projections Slice Projections Object Projections Flatten Projections Filter Projections The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the JMESPath projections documentation for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.

If you want to accept calls using multiple methods: Open the node Settings. Turn on Allow Multiple HTTP Methods. Return to Parameters. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the HTTP Methods field. The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method. Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node# The HTTP Request node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify. Create a new workflow. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow. Select a method from the Request Method dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the HTTP method in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node. Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the URL field in the HTTP Request node. If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node. Execute the HTTP Request node. Use curl to trigger the Webhook node# You can use curl to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node. Note In the examples, replace <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> with your webhook URL. The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in HTTP Method. Make an HTTP request without any parameters: 1 curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> Make an HTTP request with a body parameter: 1 curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value' Make an HTTP request with header parameter: 1 curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value' Make an HTTP request to send a file: 1 curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file' Replace /path/to/file with the path of the file you want to send. Send a response of type string# By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string: Select Response Mode > When Last Node Finishes. Select Response Data > First Entry JSON. Select Add Option > Property Name. Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to data. Connect an Edit Fields node to the Webhook node. In the Edit Fields node, select Add Value > String. Enter the name of the property in the Name field. The name should match the property name from step 4. Enter the string value in the Value field. Toggle Keep Only Set to on (green). When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node. Test URL versus Production URL# n8n generates two Webhook URLs for each Webhook node: a Test URL and a Production URL. While building or testing a workflow, use the Test URL.

They allow node parameters to be set dynamically based on data from: Previous node executions The workflow Your n8n environment You can also execute JavaScript within an expression, making this a convenient and easy way to manipulate data into useful parameter values without writing extensive extra code. n8n created and uses a templating language called Tournament, and extends it with custom methods and variables and data transformation functions. These features make it easier to perform common tasks like getting data from other nodes or accessing workflow metadata. n8n additionally supports two libraries: Luxon, for working with dates and time. JMESPath, for querying JSON. Data in n8n When writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to Data for more information on working with data in your workflows. Writing expressions# To use an expression to set a parameter value: Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression. Select Expressions in the Fixed/Expression toggle. Write your expression in the parameter, or select Open expression editor to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the Variable selector. All expressions have the format {{ your expression here }}. Example: Get data from webhook body# Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow. Your webhook data looks similar to this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 [ { \"headers\": { \"host\": \"n8n.instance.address\", ... }, \"params\": {}, \"query\": {}, \"body\": { \"name\": \"Jim\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\" } } ] In the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of city. You can use the following expression: 1 {{$json.body.city}} This expression: Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom $json variable. Finds the value of city (in this example, \"New York\"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as {{$json['body']['city']}}. Example: Writing longer JavaScript# An expression contains one line of JavaScript. This means you cannot do things like variable assignments or multiple standalone operations. To understand the limitations of JavaScript in expressions, and start thinking about workarounds, look at the following two pieces of code. Both code examples use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months, and encloses the code in handlebar brackets, like an expression. However, the first example isn't a valid n8n expression: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // This example is split over multiple lines for readability // It's still invalid when formatted as a single line {{ function example() { let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13'); let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13'); let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months'); return diffInMonths.toObject(); } example(); }} While the second example is valid: 1 {{DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13'), 'months').toObject()}} Common issues# For common errors or issues with expressions and suggested resolution steps, refer to Common Issues."

Usage# Call the helper inside the execute function. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // If no auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options); // If auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call( this, 'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi options, ); options is an object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 { url: string; headers?: object; method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'HEAD'; body?: FormData | Array | string | number | object | Buffer | URLSearchParams; qs?: object; arrayFormat?: 'indices' | 'brackets' | 'repeat' | 'comma'; auth?: { username: string, password: string, }; disableFollowRedirect?: boolean; encoding?: 'arraybuffer' | 'blob' | 'document' | 'json' | 'text' | 'stream'; skipSslCertificateValidation?: boolean; returnFullResponse?: boolean; proxy?: { host: string; port: string | number; auth?: { username: string; password: string; }, protocol?: string; }; timeout?: number; json?: boolean; } url is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is GET. Some notes about the possible fields: body: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for multipart/form-data, and URLSearchParams for application/x-www-form-urlencoded. headers: a key-value pair. If body is an instance of FormData then n8n adds content-type: multipart/form-data automatically. If body is an instance of URLSearchParams, then n8n adds content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded. To override this behavior, set a content-type header. arrayFormat: if your query string contains an array of data, such as const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}, the value of arrayFormat defines how n8n formats it. indices (default): { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a[0]=b&a[1]=c brackets: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a[]=b&a[]=c repeat: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a=b&a=c comma: { a: ['b', 'c'] } as a=b,c auth: Used for Basic auth. Provide username and password. n8n recommends omitting this, and using helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...) instead. disableFollowRedirect: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening. skipSslCertificateValidation: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate returnFullResponse: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: {body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'} encoding: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify arrayBuffer to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with. Example# For an example, refer to the Mattermost node. Deprecation of the previous helper# The previous helper implementation using this.helpers.request(options) used and exposed the request-promise library. This was removed in version 1. To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called Axios. If you are having issues, please report them in the Community Forums or on GitHub. Migration guide to the new helper# The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use. New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating: Accepts url. Doesn't accept uri. encoding: null now must be encoding: arrayBuffer. rejectUnauthorized: false is now skipSslCertificateValidation: true Use body according to content-type headers to clarify the payload. resolveWithFullResponse is now returnFullResponse and has similar behavior"

The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices. eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base contains a collection of rules for node files (*.node.ts), resource description files (*Description.ts), credential files (*.credentials.ts), and the package.json of a community package. Setup# If using the n8n node starter: Run npm install in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you. If using VS Code, install the ESLint VS Code extension. For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations. Don't edit the configuration file .eslintrc.js contains the configuration for eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base. Don't edit this file. Usage# You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository. Linting# In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the main n8n repository, the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request. In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information. You can also run the linter manually: Run npm run lint to lint and view detected issues in your console. Run npm run lintfix to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules marked as automatically fixable. Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in /packages/nodes-base/ in the main repository. Exceptions# Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it. To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on Quick fix (or cmd+. in macOS) and select Disable {rule} for this line. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please report it in the linter repository. To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the TSLint documentation for more guidance."

When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax $(node_name).item. Diagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using $('Get famous movie actors').item. Since the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using .item, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to Item linking concepts for detailed information on how this works. .item fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question. When using .item, n8n displays an error when: The thread is broken The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use) To solve these errors, you can either avoid using .item, or fix the root cause. You can avoid .item by using .first(), .last() or .all()[index] instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you’re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes for more detail on these methods. The fix for the root cause depends on the exact error. Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'# If you see this error message: ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node There's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node: Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to Item linking in the code node for more information. Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to Item linking for node creators for more information. Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'# This is the error message: ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression Sometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items. When you use .item and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either: Use .first(), .last() or .all()[index] instead.

    "content": "Remove Duplicates node# Use the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are: identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions This is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items. By comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values. Major changes in 1.64.0 The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document here. Operation modes# The remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the operation parameter: Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields. Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates. Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions. Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input# When you set the \"Operations\" field to Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields. Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters# When using the Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input operation, the following parameter is available: Compare: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available: All Fields: Compares all fields of the input data. All Fields Except: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas. Selected Fields: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas. Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options# If you choose All Fields Except or Selected Fields as your compare type, you can add these options: Disable Dot Notation: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format parent.child (turned off) or not (turn on). Remove Other Fields: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off). Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions# When you set the \"Operation\" field to Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions. Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters# When using the Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions operation, the following parameters are available: Keep Items Where: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available: Value Is New: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions. Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values. Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates. Value to Dedupe On: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the Keep Items Where parameter determines the exact format you need: When using Value Is New, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID. When using Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value. When using Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format. Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options# When using the Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions operation, the following option is available: Scope: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available: Node: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can clear the duplication history for this node instance without affecting other nodes. Workflow: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use \"workflow\" scope. n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to \"node\" scope independently. When you select Value Is New as your Keep Items Where choice, this option is also available: History Size: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the Scope option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items. Clear Deduplication History# When you set the \"Operation\" field to Clear Deduplication History, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the \"Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions\" operation uses. Clear Deduplication History parameters# When using the Clear Deduplication History operation, the following parameter is available: Mode: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available: Clean Database: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state. Clear Deduplication History options# When using the Clear Deduplication History operation, the following option is available: Scope: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database. Node: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance. Workflow: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.

Code doesn't return items properly# This error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format. In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the json key: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ { \"json\": { // your data goes here } } ] To troubleshoot this error, check the following: Read the data structure to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node. Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with item linking. A 'json' property isn't an object# This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the json key isn't pointing to an object. This may happen if you set json to a different data structure, like an array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ { \"json\": [ // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error ] } ] To resolve this, ensure that the json key references an object in your return data: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ { \"json\": { // Setting `json` to an object as expected } } ] Code doesn't return an object# This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result. To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the expected data structure: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ { \"json\": { // your data goes here } } ] This error may also occur if the code you provided returns 'undefined' instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects. 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level# This error occurs if you try to use import or export in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the require function to load modules. To resolve this issue, try changing your import statements to use require: 1 2 3 4 // Original code: // import express from \"express\"; // New code: const express = require(\"express\"); Cannot find module '<module>'# This error occurs if you try to use require in the Code node and n8n can't find the module. Only for self-hosted n8n doesn't support importing modules in the Cloud version. If you're self-hosting n8n, follow these steps: Install the module into your n8n environment. If you are running n8n with npm, install the module in the same environment as n8n. If you are running n8n with Docker, you need to extend the official n8n image with a custom image that includes your module. Set the NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN and NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL environment variables to allow importing modules.

For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates. To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the static data functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes. Use Remove Duplicates when possible If you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the Remove Duplicates node instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times."

To configure this credential, you'll need: A Bot Token: Generated once you create an application with a bot. To create an application with a bot and generate the Bot Token: If you don't have one already, create an app in the developer portal. Enter a Name for your app. Select Create. Select Bot from the left menu. Under Token, select Reset Token to generate a new bot token. Copy the token and add it to your n8n credential.

Refer to the Discord Creating an App guide for more information on creating an app, especially: Fetching your credentials for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment. Handling interactivity for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive /slash commands. Using OAuth2# Use this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app. To configure this credential, you'll need: A Client ID A Client Secret Choose whether to send Authentication in the Header or Body A Bot Token For details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in Using bot above. Then: Copy the Bot Token you generate and add it into the n8n credential. Open the OAuth2 page in your Discord application to access your Client ID and generate a Client Secret. Add these to your n8n credential. From n8n, copy the OAuth Redirect URL and add it into the Discord application in OAuth2 > Redirects. Be sure you save these changes. Using webhook# To configure this credential, you'll need: A Webhook URL: Generated once you create a webhook. To get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated: Open your Discord Server Settings and open the Integrations tab. Select Create Webhook to create a new webhook. Give your webhook a Name that makes sense. Select the avatar next to the Name to edit or upload a new avatar. In the CHANNEL dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to. Select Copy Webhook URL to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential. Refer to the Discord Making a Webhook documentation for more information. Choose an authentication method# The simplest installation is a webhook. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook. A bot is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a guild in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot. OAuth2 is basically a bot that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server."

Update rows by composite key# The MySQL node's Update operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a Column to Match On and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows. You can't use this pattern for tables that use composite keys, where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's user table in the mysql database, where you need both the user and host columns to uniquely identify rows. To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the Execute SQL operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both customer_id and product_id: 1 UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800; Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker# When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL. The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components. If only MySQL is in Docker# If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). When running the container, publish the port with the -p flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this: 1 docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest When configuring MySQL credentials, the localhost address should work without a problem (set the Host to localhost). If only n8n is in Docker# If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 on the host. If you are running n8n in Docker on Linux, use the --add-host flag to map host.docker.internal to host-gateway when you start the container. For example: 1 docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you. When configuring MySQL credentials, use host.docker.internal as the Host address instead of localhost. If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers# If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them. Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same user-defined bridge network. When configuring MySQL credentials, use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of localhost. For example, if you call the MySQL container my-mysql, you would set the Host to my-mysql. If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container# If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the localhost address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on localhost and configure the Host in the MySQL credentials in n8n to use localhost. Decimal numbers returned as strings# By default, the MySQL node returns DECIMAL values as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the MySQL library that n8n uses. To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the Output Decimals as Numbers option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings. As an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the toFloat() function with toFixed() or with the Edit Fields (Set) node after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision."

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Groq Chat Model node, and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here. Parameter resolution in sub-nodes Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression. Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} resolves to each name in turn. In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression {{ $json.name }} always resolves to the first name. Node parameters# Model: Select the model which will generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads available models from the Groq API. Learn more in the Groq model documentation. Node options# Maximum Number of Tokens: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

    "content": "Tutorial: Create environments with source control# Feature availability Available on Enterprise. You need to be an n8n instance owner, admin, or project owner to set up source control, and to send work to and from Git. This tutorial walks through the process of setting up environments end-to-end. You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers. n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to: Environments in n8n: the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n. Git and n8n: Git concepts and source control in n8n. Choose your source control pattern# Before setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different Branch patterns. For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns. Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both. Multiple instances, multiple branches# The advantages of this pattern are: An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments. It supports more than two instances. The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments. Multiple instances, one branch# The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance. The disadvantages are: If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you use a GitHub Action to automate pulls to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production. Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction. Set up your repository# Once you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository. Multi-branch Single-branch Create a new repository. Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet. Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches. Create one branch named production and another named development. Refer to Creating and deleting branches within your repository for guidance. Connect your n8n instances to your repository# Create two n8n instances, one for development, one for production. Configure Git in n8n# Go to Settings > Environments. In Git repository URL enter the SSH URL for your repository. n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select RSA under SSH Key if your git host requires RSA. Copy the SSH key. Set up a deploy key# Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to GitHub | Managing deploy keys for guidance. Connect n8n and configure your instance# Multi-branch Single-branch In Settings > Environments in n8n, select Connect. n8n connects to your Git repository. Under Instance settings, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance. Production instance only: select Protected instance to prevent users editing workflows in this instance. Select Save settings. Push work from development# In your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials. To push work to Git: Select Push in the main menu. View screenshot In the Commit and push changes modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs. Enter a commit message.

Stuck waiting for trigger event# When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the Test step or or Test workflow buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas. Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying. To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support. Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook# This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL. When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must configure the WEBHOOK_URL environment variable with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS. To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your WEBHOOK_URL environment variable to use the HTTPS address. Workflow only works in testing or production# Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL. You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications. To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production. To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference Telegram's bot documentation and the Telegram bot API reference for more information. To disable your workflow when testing, try the following: Halts production traffic This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated. Go to your workflow page. Toggle the Active switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL. When you finish testing, toggle the Inactive toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working."

    "content": "Merge# Use the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available. Major changes in 0.194.0 The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document here. Minor changes in 1.49.0 n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the Code node. The Mode > SQL Query feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions. Node parameters# You can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a Mode: Append# Keep data from all inputs. Choose a Number of Inputs to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs. Append mode inputs and output Combine# Combine data from two inputs. Select an option in Combine By to determine how you want to merge the input data. Matching Fields# Compare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in Fields to Match. n8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the Output Type setting: Keep Matches: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join. Keep Non-Matches: Merge items that don't match. Keep Everything: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join. Enrich Input 1: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join. Enrich Input 2: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join. Combine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output Position# Combine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on. Combine by Position mode inputs and output All Possible Combinations# Output all possible item combinations, while merging fields with the same name. Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output Combine mode options# When merging data by Mode > Combine, you can set these Options: Clash Handling: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to Clash handling for details. Fuzzy Compare: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats \"3\" and 3 as the same. Disable Dot Notation: This prevents accessing child fields using parent.child in the field name. Multiple Matches: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams. Include All Matches: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match. Include First Match Only: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches. Include Any Unpaired Items: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match. CLASH HANDLING# If multiple items at an index have a field with the same name, this is a clash. For example, if all items in both Input 1 and Input 2 have a field named language, these fields clash. By default, n8n prioritizes Input 2, meaning if language has a value in Input 2, n8n uses that value when merging the items. You can change this behavior by selecting Options > Clash Handling: When Field Values Clash: Choose which input to prioritize, or choose Always Add Input Number to Field Names to keep all fields and values, with the input number appended to the field name to show which input it came from. Merging Nested Fields Deep Merge: Merge properties at all levels of the items, including nested objects. This is useful when dealing with complex, nested data structures where you need to ensure the merging of all levels of nested properties. Shallow Merge: Merge properties at the top level of the items only, without merging nested objects. This is useful when you have flat data structures or when you only need to merge top-level properties without worrying about nested properties. SQL Query# Write a custom SQL Query to merge the data. Example: 1 SELECT * FROM input1 LEFT JOIN input2 ON input1.name = input2.id Data from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to AlaSQL GitHub page for a full list of supported SQL statements. Choose Branch# Choose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to Output: The Input 1 Data The Input 2 Data A Single, Empty Item The node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it. Templates and examples# Scrape and summarize webpages with AI by n8n Team View template details Telegram AI Chatbot by Eduard View template details Joining different datasets by Jonathan View template details Browse Merge integration templates, or search all templates Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items# The items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed. Branch execution with If and Merge nodes# 0.236.0 and below n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the v0 (legacy) workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your workflow settings. If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing. One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream. For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the true output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the false data stream. Try it out: A step by step example# Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node. Set up sample data using the Code nodes# Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.

    "url": "https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/",
    "content": "Let AI specify the tool parameters# When configuring app node tools connected to the Tools Agent, many parameters can be filled in by the AI model itself. The AI model will use the context from the task and information from other connected tools to fill in the appropriate details. There are two ways to do this, and you can switch between them. Let the model fill in the parameter# Each appropriate parameter field in the tool's editing dialog has an extra button at the end: On activating this button, the AI Agent will fill in the expression for you, with no need for any further user input. The field itself is filled in with a message indicating that the parameter has been defined automatically by the model. If you want to define the parameter yourself, click on the 'X' in this box to revert to user-defined values. Note that the 'expression' field will now contain the expression generated by this feature, though you can now edit it further to add extra details as described in the following section. Warning Activating this feature will overwrite any manual definition you may have already added. Use the $fromAI() function# The $fromAI() function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the Tools AI agent. You can use the $fromAI() function in expressions within app nodes (like Gmail, Notion, or Slack) which are connected to the AI Agent as tools. Only for the Node Tools The $fromAI() function is only available for app node tools connected to the Tools Agent. It isn't possible to use the $fromAI() function with the Call n8n Workflow, Code, HTTP Request, or other cluster sub-nodes. To use the $fromAI() function, call it with the required key parameter: 1 {{ $fromAI('email') }} The key parameter and other arguments to the $fromAI() function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data. For instance, if you choose a key called email, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like description to give extra context to the AI model. Parameters# The $fromAI() function accepts the following parameters: Parameter Type Required? Description key string A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. description string A string describing the argument. type string A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string). defaultValue any The default value to use for the argument. Examples# As an example, you could use the following $fromAI() expression to dynamically populate a field with a name: 1 $fromAI(\"name\", \"The commenter's name\", \"string\", \"Jane Doe\") If you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as: 1 $fromAI(\"name\") To dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a $fromAI() expression like this: 1 $fromAI(\"numItemsInStock\", \"Number of items in stock\", \"number\", 5) If you only want to fill in parts of a field with a dynamic value from the model, you can use it in a normal expression as well. For example, if you want the model to fill out the subject parameter for an e-mail, but always pre-fix the generated value with the string 'Generated by AI:', you could use the following expression: 1 Generated by AI: {{ $fromAI(\"subject\") }} Templates# You can see the $fromAI() function in action in the following templates: Angie, Personal AI Assistant with Telegram Voice and Text Automate Customer Support Issue Resolution using AI Text Classifier Scale Deal Flow with a Pitch Deck AI Vision, Chatbot and QDrant Vector Store"
