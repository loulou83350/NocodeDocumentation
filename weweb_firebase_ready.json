          "content": "When you build a WeWeb web-app, you use two type of blocks: Sections and Elements (see below for difference).\nUnder the hood, these two types of blocks are standard Vue components that have special props so that the WeWeb Editor can communicate with them.\nWe provide a lot of base elements (like editable text or image), but you can also develop your own. They are fully customizable and, when you import them in a WeWeb project, they will be usable by builders inside the WeWeb Editor in the same way as our core components (i.e. you will be able to drag-and-drop them on a page and edit their style with no-code).\nEach element or section have what we call a content : it's a data object that holds your custom properties. There are two contexts when your element or section can be loaded: inside the editor (Editor mode) or inside the published web-app (Front mode). In Editor mode the content is editable by the user, and saved on our database on each change. In Front mode the content can only change if it is bound to a dynamic value.\nYou can use the configuration file to use our build in logic to edit your section/element content, or handle yourself the edition interface . We have a strip logic available, so even if your element/section has a heavy editing logic, this will have no impact on the published web-app. You can learn more about stripping here\nYour custom components will inherit the base edition interface , like size, background color or border. Remember that a WeWeb user expects to edit them. You'll want to write your style and javascript with this in mind.\nIf you want to provide values for these WeWeb properties (padding for example), we advise you to drop an instance of your component inside the Editor, change the needed values with the Editor interface, and then save them inside the Design System. The Component source code is responsible for handling content/custom logic, and the Design system is the way to save style/preset of your components.",

Elements can be used by Sections or other Elements and can be repeated.\nYou can learn how to create a custom component here .",

When the browser finally loads up the page, it displays what you see on the screen.\nYou can see this code in your browser when you open the inspector 🕵️\nIn fact, you can even change the code on the page. When you change the code, the browser will instantly update what you see on the page.\nBut of course, when you refresh the page, the changes go away because you only made the changes locally in the browser, not in the actual code base hosted on the internet.\nIn the example below, you can see us open the browser’s inspector and update:\nThe HTML text in the button The CSS color and size of the text in the button\n\nHTML is generally used for content. It tells the browser what's on the page. For example, headings, paragraph links, images, etc.\nCSS, on the other hand, is used to style the content. For example, to change the font color or size.\nIn the past, you would have one HTML file where you would write the content and style it.\nNowadays, you write and structure the content in an HTML file. Then, you style the content in a CSS file.\nIn the HTML file, you include a link to your CSS file – also called stylesheet – and structure the content with classes and ids that make it easy to style similar elements and components in your CSS file.\nFor example, you might have several HTML files containing the content of several pages on your web app but you would like the buttons to look the same on all the pages.\nIn that case, you could add classes in your HTML files. For example, button-primary and button-secondary could refer to the main CTA button and the secondary CTA button on your pages.\nThen, in your CSS file, you could style each button class only once.\nElements in your HTML file can reference the styles in your CSS file at any time. If you make a change to that style in the CSS file, it affects any element that's using that style in your HTML file.",

          "content": "Bind to variable data Bind to collection data\nIn WeWeb, binding consists of displaying external data in your app. This is often parsed JSON coming from 3rd-party APIs or tools like Airtable or Xano.\nWhen bound, the data is displayed in the app. It can be displayed as text, as an image, as a link, as a list, etc. Every time the data is updated, the app is updated too.\nFor more details check out the binding data article.\nOption 1: Binding data\nThis method involves binding the page content directly to a variable. When a user accesses the page, the content is retrieved from this variable. Instead of making an API call to our back end and waiting for its response, we simply update a local variable and display that data on our dynamic page. For example, instead of making an API call to fetch data, you might set a variable with data received from another page. This can be quick and efficient but has limitations. Downside: If a user tries to access that URL directly to the page without going through the initial step that updates the variable, they will land on a page with no information because the variable will be empty.\nOption 2: Bind to collection data\nIn this approach, the page content is bound to data retrieved from a collection. When a user accesses the page, the data is fetched from the collection, ensuring the content is up-to-date and displayed. This method is more reliable, especially for scenarios where users might access the page directly without going through a specific sequence.\nChoosing the Right Approach: Dynamic Collection Pages offer flexibility in displaying content based on various criteria. In many use cases, you will want to make an API call to your backend to get the information from the specific item you want to display on the dynamic collection page.\nWhat you’ll need\n2 Pages\nA template page to display dynamic data An initial page with items (for this example, we will use a page with a table of data)\nPlugins\nInstall Rest API (a data source to display data)",

          "content": "First, let's have a look at the text completion product.\nHow does it work?\nIn the words of OpenAI: \"You input some text as a prompt, and the model will generate a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it.\"\nYou can ask a simple question like \"Write a tagline for an ice cream shop\" and it will return something like the answer in highlighted below:\n\nBut to leverage the true power of OpenAI, you'll often want to spend some time writing the perfect prompt with detailed instructions on the how you want the answer to look.\nLet's look at this example:\n\nWe go to the Open AI API playground We choose the Complete mode to use text completion We choose the text-davinci-003 model because it's the most recent at the time of writing We set the Temperature to 0 on a scale from 0 to 2 because we want the AI to be mathematical, not creative at all We set the Maximum length of the answer to 2000 characters because we don't want the answer to be restricted to the default 256 We write a prompt that asks OpenAI to return a regular expression patterns for emails in a certain format that we can easily reuse in our app to validate user inputs in an email field, i.e. the regular expression itself and an explanation of how it works We click on Submit Open AI returns an answer\nAs you can see, a lot of thought went into the prompt:\nwe said we wanted users to input email addresses we asked OpenAI to return the regular expression pattern in a specific format we asked OpenAI to include a text to explain how the regex was built\nSo how would it work in WeWeb?\nWell, you would take the prompt you engineered in the OpenAI playground and copy it in the plugin:\n\nTo add a prompt, you'll need to click on Add item . For each prompt, you can add as many variables as you want.\nWhen you click on Add variable , a new variable will be added to your prompt content with the default {{var1}} value:\n\nYou'll want to give it a more descriptive name so that, when you build your API request to OpenAI, you remember what value is expected.\nIn our Return Regex prompt above, we had a variable named {{need}} .\nWhen we configure the API call to OpenAI in a Workflow, it's easy for us to replicated what we had in the OpenAI API playground:\n\nIn the example above, you can see:\nwe're making a request to OpenAI's Complete API based on the text-davinci-003 model using the Return Regex prompt we configured in the plugin binding the {{need}} variable we set in the plugin to a variable on our page with a maximum token of 2000 to ensure we get a reply, and a temperature of 0 to ensure that the reply is not creative\nTo learn more about how to work with these settings, please refer to the OpenAI API documentation .",

Historically, static website builders like Webflow and builders with server-side rendering (SSR) like WordPress had an SEO advantage over tools like WeWeb, Bubble, and others that generate dynamic content in JavaScript.\nThis happens because when search engine bots first visit a JavaScript application, they initially see only the base HTML file before any JavaScript runs. In dynamic applications like WeWeb, this base file is nearly empty since all content is added later by JavaScript running in the browser. By contrast, static/SSR sites deliver complete HTML with all content already included.\nHowever, in recent years, search engines have significantly evolved to better handle JavaScript content, as more websites are built with modern JS frameworks like React or Vue. While the initial indexing might take a few extra days compared to static sites, search engine bots now effectively crawl and index JavaScript-based content during subsequent visits.\nHere are Google’s thoughts on the topic :",

Those events can be ephemereal (Broadcast) or permanent (Database changes). If users want to receive or send events in a channel, they first need to subscribe to that channel (via a WeWeb workflow action). Once they've subscribed to a channel, users can broadcast messages to that channel (via a WeWeb workflow action). They can also listen to events sent by other users in that channel (via a WeWeb workflow triggered on page or app load).",

Using a database function instead lets you write the logic once and reuse it by simply calling get_user_activity_stats() . This makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain, since any changes only need to be made in one place.\nLike having a reusable report template, database functions give you:\nSingle source of truth for your query logic Consistent data calculations and formatting Simpler code maintenance\nThis is what our function would look like:\nIf the code above seems a bit intimidating, don't fret, let's go through it line by line:\nIf you call the function with user_id = 123 , an example output could be:\nIf we tried to achieve the same for three users using only SELECT statements, our code would look like this:\nWe are repeating SELECT many times.

Did I bind the correct variable to each key? Do my form input types match the field types in my database? Does the API request I am making require authentication headers? Does the API I am working with accept client-side requests or do I need to enable the server-side option? Do I have the correct trigger on the correct element? (e.g. \"on submit\" if I'm using a \"Form Container\") Did I use the correct API endpoint URL? Did I use the correct API request method? (e.g. POST, GET, DELETE) Do the names of my keys in WeWeb match the names of my keys in my backend? (bearing in mind these are case sensitive)",

When that trigger occurs, WeWeb executes a sequence of actions you've defined. A comprehensive list of triggers can be found here.\nIn the example below, when a user logs in, we redirect them to a different page based on their role:\n\nInside workflows you can:\nTest the full workflow Set up a separate workflow if the default runs into an error Choose the event that triggers the workflow (e.g. On click , On mouse enter , etc.) Add an action to the workflow Test an individual action Click on the three vertical dots to copy/duplicate/delete an action Zoom in and out of the workflow Edit the settings of an action Close the workflow view to return to the editor",
